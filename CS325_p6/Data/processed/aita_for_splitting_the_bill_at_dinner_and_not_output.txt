In 1934 we got surname law which required women take their husband's surname. 50 years later, marriage laws was changed so women got possibility to either keep their own name, take husband's name or have two part (own family name - husband's family name). In 50 years it become tradition to take your husbands family name when getting married and some couples have awful fights of it if women don't follow tradition and take their husband's family name.",

When you're lying to people out of an embarrassment of poverty, that's just engaging in a kind of lying that the poor to middle class does all around the world.      When lower to middle class people buy Chanel bags that they can't afford that's not typically part of an elaborate plan to cheat people out of money. It's a reaction to insecurity. The problem is that some % of this insecurity is imagined... and some of it is real. When you are poor you are not secure, and there's a humiliation to broadcasting that you're financially scared to eat among peers.      Masculinity is also a likely contributor to some of this insecurity, but again, it's not the only contributor. A core part of this insecurity is real      I grew up in a mixed-income community. We were aligned through some other axis but recognized that money divides us. My mixed-income friends grew up developing a concept of kindness and harmony by trying to understand how this works. In short, my friends would've helped cover for my embarrassment, they would reduce the pressure to pretend, especially if they're richer friends inviting me to a restaurant I don't feel comfortable with.      Is accidentally dropping money into someone's car a ridiculous dance? Yes. Is giving a loan you plan never to remind them about a silly lie to save face? Yes.

He shouldn't care what other people think, but that's a high bar to clear for most people — especially when they're the outsider coming into a tight group, especially when they're already insecure about their \"lower\" social status, especially when they care about a relationship and want their partner's friends to like them.      Yes, his suggestion was silly — but so is the expectation that men should always pay for the whole group. And most people feel uncomfortable not adhering to a group's social norms, especially when it singles them out, again, as somehow inferior.      If you want this relationship to work despite your socioeconomic differences — and your boyfriend isn't normally sexist and insecure — I would encourage you to have some empathy for your boyfriend's embarrassment, and work out a plan for the next time something like this happens. It's kind of hard to work out what that might look like without changing the standard that your male friends always pay... but maybe the next time, you choose the restaurant — one that isn't crazy expensive; or maybe it would help to reassure your bf that your friends aren't judgmental snobs (as hopefully they aren't); or maybe you don't bring him along to friend dinners for awhile until he feels more comfortable.      If, on the other hand, your boyfriend is in general hung up on you having more money than him no matter the social context, then I would probably dump him.",

I imagine he thought that, even though they weren't outwardly saying it, they were thinking he wasn't \"a real man\" for not paying. So now he's in a bind since he really cannot afford it but also doesn't want to look bad in front of his girlfriend's friends now he realised what the norms are in this group. Obviously he's wrong for trying this, but I do feel a bit bad for the guy.",

Blah blah blah modern society but, in this particular context as you stated, it was common for the men to pay for the women. Now Ben has been added into the situation and the writing is very clearly on the wall that he is supposed to step up and pay for part of it as one of the men in the group.      Outdated as it may be, in that situation, your group made it very clear that that was expected. You may not realize it, because you're simply used to it, but as a new person joining the group, particularly a new man, there's a lot of (probably unexpected) pressure all of the sudden with clear social guidelines.      The reason why your boyfriend leaned over to talk to you about it, was because of that clear sudden social pressure to chip in as one of the men in the group.      I understand where you're coming from because I am also very much a practical woman and this is an impractical situation. And I can see where your solution comes from because in your eyes it's just a matter of helping the friends split the bill.      However in Ben's eyes, it's a matter of that amongst your friends the men split the bill and pay for the women. By announcing that you are as a woman going to split the bill as well, you have now broken that social construct.      And you're probably right, that your friends don't really care, but you also know your friends a lot better than Ben does. So in Ben's eyes it was clear that he as a man was supposed to pick up part of the bill and now his girlfriend made an announcement that she was going to pick it up instead.      Again I don't think that you're the a-hole in this situation because I think you simply misread it, however I do think you might want to sit down and talk to Ben a little bit and let him express himself with what was going through his head in that situation.",

Important information which is obviously left out because OP doesn't think it's worth talking about. But let's take a moment to think about it.      The median personal income in the US is roughly 40k with the median household being roughly 75k. The average household in America spent about $3,600 a year eating out in 2022. Assuming he's your average median income earner and given they're in different income brackets, she may make double or more than what he makes. Per her words, she's not impressed by what he can offer and she's not sure he can even afford a meal for 8 split 3 ways. The average consumer spends $20-$30/person when eating out.  We'll use $30 for this average model, we're expecting at minimum a $240 bill + 20% tip so $288 split 3 ways for $96. So if they went the average experience route, she's saying he can't afford to fork up $96. Okay, his budget might be pretty tight if that's the case.      But let's use the high number from the source since they're in different income brackets and she's not sure he can even afford the meal, so $98/person. We'd be look at $940.8 split 3 ways, and for most, spontaneously people forking up $313.6 for one meal is pretty fucking expensive.      So yeah, OP can say she doesn't care. But, her circle is definitely in the money if it's the second scenario. And she knows her boyfriend isn't in the money. So maybe just a little inconsiderate of what normal income level earners can afford.",

Notice how OP conveniently didn't comment on this comment chain, instead opting to address the others, which fall in line with her not being the asshole.      The situation is that her group of friends are all higher income earners, but also push the ideology that men care for and support women, not that it's a 2-way street. This is THEM instilling toxic masculinity within their friend group. That is the baseline expectation for OP's boyfriend. He is supposed to provide. And while OP might claim he isn't looked down on, there is no doubt that behind the scenes, they are judging.      Now, maybe the boyfriend could be more secure in his relationship. My girl and I split costs such that she pays for the food and internet, while I handle the rent and electricity. To the outsider, it looks like she's always paying, but in reality, housing is probably double what our food costs are. I really don't give a shit what others think, though. With that being said, these are \"friends\" of hers, who are subversively pushing the old ideology that a man covers the cost. Instead of just letting him pay now and sending him the money to cover it, what she did was emasculate him in public, and to people who absolutely are judging him and his character. This was really tone-deaf of OP to do. If she's fine with abandoning these friends when they start talking about how her boyfriend doesn't pay, then that's the case it is, but I have no doubt that there will be talk among them about who was paying.",

By paying instead of boyfriend, OP has put boyfriend on lower footing than his peers in the group at a time when he’s presumably working to build those relationships. If the friend group is an important part of OP’s life, and OP anticipates a long term relationship with boyfriend, then this was a disservice to boyfriend and their relationship. Maybe the group doesn’t care, but I would guess that there is a subtle implication there simply by the fact that the rule exists to begin with.      As mentioned in other comments, this is irrespective of the broader societal toxic masculinity issues. This isn’t a situation where boyfriend was proactively trying to look good by paying for the group “as the man” and having OP reimburse him behind the scenes. This is a situation where men paying is “table stakes” for the group. The norm itself certainly has toxic masculinity implications, but boyfriend’s intent seems to be focused on adhering to the group’s norm and not asserting dominance.      Slightly YTA, because it doesn’t seem like you caught onto that nuance in the moment or compromising (like boyfriend pays, OP reimburses and boyfriend pays her back over time by taking more of the cost of the next few dates).",

I am sure Ben would have been happy with everyone picking up their own tab but that not the way writer’s friends roll.  Apparently they expect the man to pay.  That wasn’t Ben’s call.      The result is going to be that Ben won’t want to go out to dinner with you and your friend group.  Hey, let’s go to a restaurant that is above your pay grade, then you can feel inadequate because you are not the earner that my friends are dating, and by the way, I am going to make sure everyone knows you are not the earner that my friends date by announcing to everyone that I have to pay. Do you really think this is what Ben signed up for when he agreed to go to dinner with your friends.  Wanna bet Ben had the lowest tab of all six.  “No just water and salad for me because I am expected to pay for the shooters’ meals too.”",

The beginning of that relationship was extremely difficult to overcome my financial insecurities. That's what the above scenario is. It's his financial insecurities topped with the social construct that was placed suddenly on him at dinner. This is a new relationship, he's already struggling with the social construct of feeling the need to impress you with higher quality dates/dinners, and upon meeting your friends he wants to set a good impression on them. It takes empathy to understand that, which my (now) ex showed me many times. My current relationship, the roles are reversed and I would have just given him my card to \"show\" that he paid for me. It's an agreement we have set up and works for us.      If this relationship is worth the effort for you, I suggest having a sit with him and discuss this and come up with ways to help both of you feel more comfortable to overcome these scenarios together.      Best of luck.      NAH",

Blaming her for \"misreading\" the situation is absurd, she knows exactly what it is: a man being made to feel emasculated by a situation and instead of just dealing with that on his own, he asked her to lie to her friends to protect his feelings and then got mad over a feeling he had about himself he's trying to pin on her friends (no one batted an eye, remember?).

But they just went out and got anything that they wanted. So it wasn't about 'getting' them a present for Christmas or their birthday or whatever, but making the time to show them they were appreciated. Making a meal, or taking them to go do something fun, or spending the day being a wrench monkey with them in the garage.      Buying you nice things isn't the move. Tell him what makes you feel happy and loved. Is it acts of service? Is it writing you poetry? Is it making time to spend with you? Making you laugh?      If a man makes me laugh and feeds me, I'm already 70% in love. Bringing me home a fancy beverage from the grocery store when he goes out means just as much to me as planning a date night? Because he's thinking about me and wants to make me happy. And I've told my past partners, when you do X, I feel X. (That works for positive and negative stuff) Because if they're listening, they can adjust from there. I like asking my partners all the things so I can figure out how to make them feel valued and loved. Do they need to hear it? Is it just that I touch them whenever I can? Do they like when I tease them or do I need to be gentle with their feelings? Whatever.      If you want to build a life with someone, paying attention to what actually brings them joy is kind of like, key to the whole thing.",

OP's boyfriend shows up and want to appear to continue that tradition and suddenly he is sexist, misogynistic and has outdated views? Seriously? So, all this time Ben and Max, including the women who were OK with that tradition somehow aren't any of those things? This is why some men say women only want special privileges under the pretext of feminism and that they couldn't care less about the essence of feminism and equality. Hypocrisy at its finest.      Also, I thought women were supposed to be more emotionally intelligent than men? This man is telling you - not even playing the game of to read my mind or guess my feelings like some of y'all do - he is straight up telling you how he feels about the situation and not just societal expectation, but your group's expectation as well and how it would make him look in front of your friends and you're like nope, don't care if you feel humiliated or emasculated; in fact, I'm going to do it publicly. Why would anyone treat someone they care about this way? I don't undemand how the way men make women feel about themselves is such an important thing to some women, yet the moment they get to reciprocate or make their man look good they take that opportunity to either insult him, emasculate him or call him all sorts of things I'm seeing in this thread. What does it cost you to have him pay and zelle him back? Yes, it's an extra step but extra steps are what people do to people they care about. And then everyone is surprised why men don't open up more. When money is in play, it's not that women with money intimidate men. That's just something women say to make themselves feel better. What men don't like is the way women with money treat them or make them feel. There is a difference. And no one, man or woman, likes to feel humiliated or disrespected much less in front of your bf/gf.      Plus you best believe that this is amunition to OP's friends.

The profiles allowed daters’ to report their own income and the minimum income they desired in a dating partner, and we analyzed these data at the level of zip code. Our analysis shows that women engage in more resource seeking than men.  https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11129-010-9088-6    Many of the user messaging behaviors align with notions in social and evolutionary psychology: males tend to look for younger females while females place more emphasis on the socioeconomic status (e.g., income, education level) of a potential date.  https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-12188-8_9    Men and women differed in the percentage indicating it was “desirable” or “essential” that their potential partner was good-looking (92% vs. 84%; d = .39), had a slender body (80% vs. 58%; d = .53), had a steady income (74% vs. 97%; d = 1.17), and made/will make a lot of money (47% vs. 69%; d = −.49). There were also gender differences in whether it was “very important” or “a must have” their partner made at least as much money as they do (24% vs. 46%; d = .60) and had a successful career (33% vs. 61%; d = .57), but not in whether their partner was physically attractive to them (40% vs. 42%; d = .03).  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886915005462    Lemme dumb it down for ya: it's women that impose the sexist requirements on the men in the first place!

Although that's not really the case anymore and women these days vastly outdo men ( my wife for example makes almost 30k more than me) it's still an expectation that's been drilled into us that we pay for nearly everything. Whether women see it that way or not, that's how men are raised to believe. Hence why your friends keep taking the bill and didn't just split it amongst everyone.

And the fact that this is a frequent topic of conversation. How stressed he gets that his income is not enough to impress you, or even keep up with your baseline spending habits apparently. And you tell him don't worry about it, which is fine. But then when given the opportunity for you to actually make a gesture to SHOW him he doesn't need to worry about it, not only do you fail to step in and help him out before it becomes embarrassing for him, even after he asks you to do something to avoid embarrassment for him, you listen, and then refuse to do so, and end up doing exactly the thing that embarrasses him even more.      I don't think you're doing this maliciously, but its clear you either have no understanding about what he is feeling, or no desire to go out of your way to help lessen those feelings for him.",

His actions are seriously immature, and he clearly is afraid of looking at himself honestly. However, you 100% did not have his back. To him, that was incredibly embarrassing. And to add to the insult, you brushed it off as not important. There's a reason men don't announce that their woman is on her period. Is it something to be embarrassed about? No. No one cares. But you can also trust I would never say it at a dinner party in front of company, either. And let's say I did let it slip, on accident. My first words would not be, \"No one cares, it's not a big deal.\" My first words would be I'm sorry, i didn't mean to humiliate you. Unfortunately, we don't get to choose what is or isn't important to the person we're with. We only get to choose whether or not to respect it.      And for the obvious reasoning that some keyboard warrior is going to clap back with. Yes. These are entirely different scenarios. I understand that. I'm saying that there's a certain level of \"I've got your back\" that is missing from OP's attitude. I personally would not want to date someone that is so willing to steamroll the things that matter to me and then tell me I'm being dramatic when I said how I felt about it.      For the ladies that don't care who knows about their period. Yes. I get it. You're so confident. No one cares. You missed the point.      Final thing I will say is that in this particular scenario, I still think you did the right thing. He put you in an impossibly stupid position and you did what you felt was right.

It wouldn't have been that big of a deal to you to let the guy have this, but you said no and took away the moment. I think it says more about you needing \"equality\" in that moment than caring for someone whom, as you noted has some insecurities. Why are you with him if you're unwilling to accept him for this issue. Again, I understand if he is taking full advantage of you and leaching off of you financially, but it seems like he's willing to pay you back right?",

It's silly and it should not be the case but sadly gender norms are often so ingrained into our brains at a base level that it is none the less the case.      In the same way a women might feel entirely responsible for children, even if she has a spouse who does 100% of his share of parenting, the women often feels responsible for parenting particularly in social situations.  Or if a couple is hosing other people for a dinner party, the women often feels a higher level of responsibility for the tidiness of the home or the quality of the food even if her and her partner share those duties equitability.      I learned this lesson during a Christmas Dinner for my family that my GF and I at the time hosted.  It was nothing major but my parents place was going through a reno so we hosted my family at our apartment.  It was not our first time having them over for dinner but THIS was christmas dinner, not a normal dinner.      In the weeks leading up to it my GF was just going insane.  The decorating, the tidying, the practice cooking.  The stress was causing arguments, it was becoming a problem.  It took me time but eventually we figured out that the reality of the dinner was secondary to how she was feeling about the dinner.      To her, hosting christmas dinner was a HUGE deal.  Something that her mother (and my mother) took very seriously as the women of the house.  Even though we were sharing the actual work, to her it was an exercise in proving her worth as a wife/mother/women but to me it was just dinner with the parents.      I bring up this example because I want you to imagine yourself in that situation.  You might have a gender balanced relationship but where feelings get involved reality sometimes slides away.      In this way, gender norms still impact our thinking and self image in ways that we disagree with on an intellectual level but on a more instinctual level those thoughts are still there.      Your BF wanted to save face in front of the other guys by appearing to be the one who paid. This was not really about you or your relationship but much more about his own insecurities as a man in front of other men.  It doesn't really matter if they were actually judging him or not, what matters is that he was judging himself.      My mom was not going to start hating my GF if her Christmas Turkey was less than perfect.  Both my GF and mom are modern women and neither really are master cooks.  But the Christmas dinner thing was more about how my GF was feeling about herself than anything our guests would have actually thought.      This struck me as totally absurd because firstly, it’s an unnecessary step, second even split the cost was something I wasn’t sure he would realistically be able to cover, and third I felt like he was trying to enter a pissing contest with my friends which was just childish.      You are 100% correct, but I still think it's something that you could have done anyway.  It's not that big a deal, it's not really any additional cost or work and it would have made your BF feel more secure about something that you are already aware that he's insecure about.      To that end, the ultimate answer here is that you get rid of the insecurity.  To do that is actually deceptively simple.  See he does not actually care about the income difference, this is much more about feelings than it is about income.      He wants to feel like you appreciated him as a man and as a provider.  He wants to feel like your friends think he's a good long term partner for you that they're not out there talking behind his back that you should be with someone with more money.  He's insecure, and that's OK.  It's OK to be insecure.      So instead there's little things that you can do day to day that will kill the insecurity on a long term basis.  Then next dinner it won't matter who pays because he won't be feeling insecure.   And the key is right here..      Ben and I are from different income brackets, and Ben has expressed that he sometimes feels a little bit weird about this because he is a gentleman at heart but he says it’s hard to treat me since I’m not really impressed by his gestures.      Be impressed by his gestures.  Don't fake what you do not feel, but recognize the sacrifice he makes in doing the gesture even if it's not as large a sacrifice for you.      For example, you two go out on a night out.  The dinner bill comes and Ben grabs it to pay.  You both know that this dinner is not that special for you, you go to such restaurants all the time.  But Ben paying is a gesture he is making to show you that he cares, take it in the sprit that it's given. You smile, you thank him and you kind of make it a bigger deal than it really is.  Pump up his ego a little bit.      I'd leave you with this analogy.  Not every BJ is the best BJ I've ever recelived.  But you'd never know it from my reactions.  Whenever someone has my dick in their mouth I'll act as if it's the best BJ I've ever received.",

You should have prepped him for this scenario and had a game plan. I get that you inherited your wealth so you have no idea what it’s like to grind and work your way to a successful living, but for many of us that is the route we need to take. And you need to understand how fucking terrible it just feel for you BF to be surrounded seemingly with people who had endless funds and he’s barely scraping by.      Yes - he was indeed “emasculated” as you put him in a situation where he was expected, socially, to meet a bar that he was not capable of meeting. And then you embarrassed him for it. Definitely YTA.      People here actually expect Ben to be chill with this? He needs to “grow up?” You guys are talking about equality and how this man is misogynistic? Come on.",

In this case who was the single person, or were there even any other couples? Usually in this case we do an even split or one person puts a CC down and the rest Venmo there share or split evenly.",

Op's disdain for Ben's pressure from social obligation is incredibly dense. OP may believe that men paying for women is old-fashioned nonsense yet it is very prevalent still and \"the two guys “Max” and “Harry” said they would get the bill, as the guys usually do\". Giving/receiving social obligations can be quite strong and a social faux pas can be crushing. Dear OP, let's take out the money and gender aspects for a moment. Imagine you turn up to what you thought were casual birthday drinks for a friend but everyone but you brought a present. You go to meet your bfs parents and they give you a nice gift and you got them nothing. It just feels really bad. You lead Ben right into this sort situation. Your offering to help split does nothing. Maybe it moves some attention away from the \"man should pay\" thing but it just highlights the \"but can't afford to\" thing.      OP has a few options on who to date with regard to this stuff. Only wealthy people. Someone like Ben, who doesn't feel comfortable receiving more than they give, wants to take care of others, and has polite social conditioning. Someone isn't wealthy but is more than happy to get a free dinner. Won't offer to pay ever. Happy to go on expensive holidays without paying. Won't ever bother with any guilt at all. A free loader would be so much worse.      So I would say OP, realise that you have the privilege of not being burdened by such social mores. So looking down on him for finding certain situations difficult when you don't is pretty yuck. But he also needs to realise that if he wants to stay with you, these situations will arise from time to time. You both need to get on the same page. He needs to let go of his archaic views on men providing for women. He needs to realise that this is an internal problem, that his own, self-imposed rules are inflicting pressure on only himself. You, however, need to realise that we live in a framework of unseen social contracts which exert pressure on people differently. Two which Ben follows rigorously are \"Pay your own way/don't freeload\" and \"Gentlemen provide for women\". One is unproblematic for you and your social circle, the other simply doesn't affect you. You aren't \"above\" such childish things. You are privileged. It sounds like you can do a lot worse than this guy, so try to work it out",

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read this before contacting the mod team    I (24f) have been dating “Ben” (26M) for eight months. For context, Ben and I are from different income brackets, and Ben has expressed that he sometimes feels a little bit weird about this because he is a gentleman at heart but he says it’s hard to treat me since I’m not really impressed by his gestures. I’ve said many times that I’m not concerned about these kind of things either way, but it comes up periodically.      Last night Ben and I went to dinner with 6 of my friends. There were 3 men in total and 5 women. At the end of the dinner the two guys “Max” and “Harry” said they would get the bill, as the guys usually do when we’re out. Ben quietly said to me that he wasn’t really comfortable with the guys paying for his dinner so I said I’d chip in with the bill. Ben said thank you but could he chip in and then I could pay him back afterwards because he didn’t want them to know I was paying.      This struck me as totally absurd because firstly, it’s an unnecessary step, second even split the cost was something I wasn’t sure he would realistically be able to cover, and third I felt like he was trying to enter a pissing contest with my friends which was just childish.      I said no I would just pay and then turned to everyone and said I’d chip in a third of the bill. No one batted an eyelid, but Ben was sulking.      He’s now mad at me saying I emasculated him and made him look bad in front of my friends. I think he’s overdramatising it because my friends couldn’t care less and he needs to get over himself.

He needs to be upfront about his boundaries when it comes to money, since this seems like a big deal to him when you and your friend group couldn’t care less. But I will also say that maybe you need to reevaluate your relationship with a man who is so uncomfortable with your financial inequality that he’s mad at you for paying instead of pretending that he paid. That continued line of action would inevitably dig him into a hole that’s hard to get out of.

It's been 8 months and he's already shown you he wants to be 'the big man' and the fact you can pay for your own thing, and more, makes him feel insecure, so insecure even that he wants to borrow money from you so in front of your friend group he can pretend to be 'the big man'. Lol, I would not be with someone like this. His behaviour is not healthy and totally unproductive.      I do think it's ridiculous that in a friend group, two of the three men suggest covering the whole bill (so the 5 women, and 1 man don't have to pay). That sounds like some sexist stuff right there. Sounds like your culture has more sexism and perhaps that's the reason your bf feels the need to be 'the big man'...      But yeah, this will keep being an issue with him, and to me, his behaviour is really unattractive. He also shouldn't need money to impress you, he could make thoughtful gestures and organise cute dates that don't cost much but show you how well he is getting to know you, etc.      A friend's BF got himself into a lot of debt because he wanted to be seen as 'the man'. He only had a lower-paying job but I think he was doing alright living a more frugal lifestyle (in an expensive city, though) but I guess because there were no career advancement opportunities and he didn't want to go back to higher education, he probably felt like he was never going to make more money, but he still wanted to be seen as the 'big man'. So he got into debt so he could buy rounds of drinks for his friends, treat friends to meals out etc. It eventually came out and his long-term GF was obviously not happy. Not only had he been lying and putting himself into debt, trying to get out of debt was also going to be a long process because obviously now he had to be even more frugal to cover all those loan repayments... Your BF needs to deal with his emotional issues now or I would bail. You can't be with someone who lets himself be driven by these kinds of insecurities: he will end up putting himself into debt, possibly stealing things to impress you (or your social group), hiding his financial problems from you, or always sulking and being insecure around money. That's super annoying to deal with because you will always feel like you have to protect his fragile ego, like in this case where he asked you to front him some money so he could look like the man to his friends/your friends, even though he can't afford it. Just don't go along with it. Nip that stuff in the bud right now or move on to a guy who either makes more money or who is just more secure and confident in himself and who can graciously accept that you sometimes might pay more or even just half. He needs to wake up to the 21st century where as women we can also get paid work and even get great jobs because we are now also allowed to go to (higher) education.",

I had a similar relationship. It started small, little by little, things that didn't seem like a huge deal, until I realized:      My (now ex) husband refused to tell me how much money he made.      He would have me sign my paycheck and hand it over, where he would deposit it.      While my name was on the bank account, I was \"not allowed\" to spend any money (he would scream at me if I bought myself lunch).      He would tell me that since I was better at not being an impulse spender, that he should be allowed to spend more money than I was (what money? I couldn't spend any on myself!) because being restricted felt more like a punishment to him.      He would take money out and spend as he wanted, and hide the purchases from me. Some of the purchases became too big to hide, such as an X-Box and a 500.00 \"controller\" for a mech game, that was a lap panel with buttons, switches, levers, lights, and floor pedals.      When we got together, he already had a huge loan that he owed his mother. With his bad spending habits it continued to snowball (and so did out bills), until he decided that I now owed his mother too, because instead of paying her back, he was using money on our bills.      He asked my mother for a loan to buy a new computer, then never paid her back. When we split, he \"generously\" offered to pay off his debt to his own mother, then told me I would be responsible for the debt to my mother...you know, the one I never agreed to or knew about until after the fact? Yeah, that one. And then when he left, he proceeded to not only take the computer he'd bought with her money, but he took my computer too (and any other high-dollar valuables)! When my mother complained that he owed her, he told her to talk to me. I redirected her to him and reminded him that he took the computer he was asking me to pay for, with him, so why would I pay for something I didn't own, use, or agree to in the first place?      It started with small things that seemed trivial, and then one day you look up and wonder how the heck you got here. (As for the emasculation part, if you're wondering where that is, that presented in a different way, mostly him telling me I couldn't wear makeup or dress nice or have my hair a certain way, because he didn't want other guys wondering what I was doing with him. Stuff like that.)",

Not that it's a man/woman thing, but social norms around group dinners and payment indeed raise an issue of who is paying for what. If he is not part of your customary group dynamic, to expect him to understand Chazz and Squee's generous habit of paying for six ladies' dinner is gaslight-y.  It's not like the guy/girl thing was even his dynamic.  Payment of his own dinner is even moreso - if he doesn't know these guys like that, then he may feel a debt has been created.  That would not be unreasonable because people generally expect things in return. So if he doesn't know Chazz and Squee, wouldn't HE look like an asshole to assume they are paying for him without batting an eye?      Again, only partially asshole though.

To be blunt, his sulking probably made his standing in the group worse than if he'd just sat back and let the two guys or the three of you pay.      So sit Ben down and talk out money and things like that night. When my wife and I started to date I was in Ben's shoes. She earns more than I do, and her friends' idea of a fun dinner are a few $$$ more than I usually spend. But she too has a tastes like mine, enjoying fun ethnic food rather than fancy spendy places. But the whole point is to talk it through and be on the same page.      Maybe he can take you on a date and play the gentleman, let it be his treat, etc. That way he can plan accordingly based on what is affordable to him. Then sometimes the bill for the two of you is shared, or you treat. But when you do something like the dinner with your friends that you agree ahead of time how to handle the payments. My wife and I do that, so if we're with her friends she'll ask me to grab or share the check and we work the $$$ out privately later. That way finances are between us, not the group, and both of us are working within our budgets.      Just to be clear, this can work out for both of you if you talk to each other honestly. My wife and I are doing fine after 15 years. This year the financial balance shifted as she's stopped working because she has savings to allow that.

Which is fine, it’s not an asshole move. But it doesn’t negate that you didn’t pick his feelings. He was embarrassed in front of your friends, they might not have batted an eye but they likely did notice and you have no way to tell if they truly did or not. Even if they didn’t, he felt judged enough and  bad enough about not being able to pay that honestly, this may end up in a breakup because he has it in his head he isn’t good enough for you financially and his face got rubbed in it publicly in this instance.      It sounds like a lot of this advice isn’t coming from people in relationships, maybe I’m wrong, but I don’t think what you did was very kind to him. Again, you weren’t wrong to, but sometimes even if it’s not wrong it’s not kind especially because you knew his situation and that it was already causing him grief and insecurity.",

Remind him of the reasons he has worth other than money, and outside of the stereotype of patriarchal breadwinner. e.g. he's kind / he's good at his job / he's creative / he supports you emotionally / he looks after his family / he always takes the bins out / he makes the coffee in the morning / he's great in bed / he makes you laugh... etc etc. I think he is probably struggling to compute that he can support you and be a 'provider' without just providing money.

He checks the bill, ( note: I have trouble reading the receipt in dim lighting) calculates the tip, asks me if the tip is acceptable (there are places/wait staff we see a lot,,so sometimes I want to add to the tip). I don’t think anyone knows or cares whose name is on the card, unless you say to the group, “here is MY credit card and will be paying for my boyfriend!”.  Judge your boyfriend based on all his behavior over time. There are a lot of people (most?)who still believe the man should pay for everything regarding dating, I would cut him a break if it happens once in a blue moon, however I agree that he is the asshole if this is how he acts normally, or if it continues. If this happens a lot, it is or is going to be an issue. Is it possible that the group of people made him hyper sensitive or that he didn’t want to deal with the teasing this group might do? Edit: I said that lots of people think the man should pay, you must feel this to some degree when you said there were 3 men and 5 women, but two of the men offered to take care of the entire bill as they normally do - obviously, with this group, it is expected and accepted for “The Men” to take care of the bill.  You could have responded “no, please, let us pitch in as well” that would be the polite thing to do. And again if his usual reaction is to want people to think he is the “manly man” and pays for his “woman”, then this is a problem! But if it was in a mixed setting, and it was common practice for “the men” to pay the bill, then I would cut him a break.",

Your BF felt embarrassed, and you did not quell that feeling. Not saying you were wrong or he was, but you did not take his feelings into account when doing what you did.

You say nobody batted an eye,  but he does now look like a deadbeat to anyone with any shred of the traditional values that Ben values as a self-proclaimed gentleman.      You don't care about those things, but it doesn't mean that your friends don't care about those things.      You say that your friends couldn't care less, but someone not reacting doesn't mean that they don't have an opinion. It just means that they aren't socially awkward. You might have known your friends for decades. and know that this isn't important to them, but Ben doesn't know them like you do.      If Harry or Max have any sort of attraction to you, your boyfriend now looks like a joke to them. IF these guys were his friends, it would be a different story, They would be jealous that he found a woman who wants him for him, and not his money. But they aren't his friends, they are your friends, Now your male friends know he doesn't make enough to be in the same socio-economic circles as you and your friends.  Which means that your boyfriend is going to feel embarrassed around them. Now it means that if either Harry or Max has or builds a crush on you, He needs to constantly worry about them trying to make a move.      Harry and Max obviously make more money than your boyfriend if they could afford this restaurant and he couldn't, they could support your lifestyle without your inheritance better than he could. This will be a common topic for the rumor mill amongst your friends. He probably feels that your friends are going to talk about him behind your back. Even if your friends aren't something to worry about, As your relationship continues, many other people will say that he isn't good enough for you because he can't support your lifestyle. And he can't deny that, because he really can't support your lifestyle.      The whole thing is an ego game. But all confidence is rooted in ego to some extent.  If you want him to remain confident despite hits to his ego, you are asking him to be arrogant.  If you regularly do this, and never let him even look like he is in your same socio-economic class, other richer and more confident guys are going to ignore that he even exists if they are interested in you, because from their outside perspective, your boyfriend just drags you down and you would be better off without him.      If you aren't going to let him pretend to pay, you definitely need to make sure that you give the impression that you want to pay for him because you find him so irresistible. Ben thinks of himself as a gentleman, he views behaving like a gentleman to be a good thing, and he not only can't do those things, but you made it clear to your friends that he can't do those things.",

You would start to feel like a free loader eventually. Especially since it’s not your core friend group but people you associate with because of your boyfriend. To make matters worse he’s spoken to you about it previously. If you agree or not you could have asked you r friend group let’s all get separate checks when we go somewhere expensive. If the men want to then reimburse the women through Zelle or whatever then do that. Yes that’s an extra step but so what. Or end the relationship if you can’t respect his feelings.",

If anything, I'd think they would judge both of you if you'd let him pay only to give him money later and they found out (because friends know shit like that). And if you weren't sure he'd be able to cover even the portion you probably saved him a much bigger embarrassment of his card being declined in front of everyone.      My ex used to say I emasculated him for doing stuff like paying for dinner or being the one to drive us places or putting together an Ikea table, etc. If a man is emasculated by something so simple as picking up the dinner tab that isn't anything YOU did wrong, it's his insecurities shining through.      Currently I (46f) am more than a couple income brackets above my fiance (39M) we used to run into this in the beginning of our relationship...but it was a very short lived thing as he eventually got over it.  He delayed meeting me IRL for a couple months because money was really tight (we started talking right after the holidays and his job at the time was weather dependent and winter was rough) and he wanted to be able to pay for a proper date.  The only time it comes up now is when I get him a pricy gift for his birthday and he regrets not being able to do the same for me. His financial situation has changed since we first got together but I still earn considerably more and pay for things more often than not and he's become okay with. He will always grab the check when he knows he comfortably can and I always let him have his moment. Confident men are comfortable with a partner who makes more than them because they know money doesn't define masculinity. I think it takes a much more secure man to admit he earns less and be okay with it. That security often comes with time and experience that your boyfriend doesn't have yet...not because of his age exactly, just his circumstances in life.",

It’s a circumstance he needs to get used to, but I see no reason that he anyone should be used to it the first time it happens, nor is there some age at which it should happen by.      He probably didn’t realize what was going to happen when the check came. It’s not exactly a pissing contrst(where each guy tries to outdo the other). He was embarrassed, and tried to appear as though he was keeping up.      If he’s embarrassed for them to pay, he shouldn’t use your money. You shouldn’t have embarrassed him by saying something publicly while he was trying to keep it quiet. You both made equal mistakes. You should communicate with each other, and  see the other person’s side. You might need to be a little careful with his ego. He definitely needs to come to terms with the fact that being with you means that financially he’s not going to be the one making all the money and all the decisions.

That a lot of people demean their spouses in public as a joke, and it isn’t ok. That there is room to be sensitive to the parts of our partner we don’t understand.      That said, he’s asking you to be complicit in a lie. That’s really not ok.      The thing is, there’s something all of us will be unreasonably sensitive about in life. We should work on it, but our spouse should still be our safe place. Knowing your spouse is sensitive about this, I would maybe put the relationship ahead of the details next time. I’d just say, “we‘ll chip in, too” and leave it at that. Ask that he does the same for you when something you’re sensitive about comes up in public.      Again, you’re justified. You didn’t do anything wrong. Maybe he should suck it up.

I grew up really poor and then went to an elite private college with friends who had lots of money. I dated a girl in college who, when I went home with her for Christmas she said, “offer to pay the bill at dinner, they will say ‘no’ and tell you that you never need to offer again.” That is exactly how it played out.      But I can tell you I was insanely nervous in that moment and every time they spent money on me or elsewhere with her friends I felt so insecure. It is really hard to explain — and I don’t necessarily think it’s a gender thing. It’s just hard. Money has such an unconscious power over people.      Ultimately, I broke up with my girlfriend after 3 years together because our relationship grew toxic. When I did her parents said “after all we’ve done for you, all the money we’ve spent, this is how you treat her?” And “you should expect a bill.” And told her “no more charity boyfriends.”      Nothing could have hurt more. If I could project some emotions onto him, he is probably feeling scared, like he is in debt and afraid of how that plays out over your relationship.      The upside: it is something you can work through. My next gf (also wealthy family) and I talked about it early and I told her how hard it can be, we had long convos about it and how to navigate situations. Now we’re married, have two kids, and I make a bundle of money (she does too!). I don’t owe my wife money, I owe her all of my love for the enormous amount of empathy and patience she showed me during that time.",

He is comfortable enough with you to admit his insecurity, but this does not remove the feeling that others will judge him. This is why it continues to come up. You have demonstrated that it is not important to you that he has less wealth, but he still thinks others will see the situation and make judgements.      The arrangement he proposed in front of your friends was designed to disguise the fact that he would have been the only male person there who was not contributing to the bill. He wants to impress your friends and feel like he belongs with this crowd and his lower income feels like a barrier to that. We get ourselves into these awkward situations when we start thinking about how things \"should\" be. He is not comfortable with your friends knowing that he is not able to afford the same things that they can. You may know that your friends wont judge him for that but he doesn't know them that well. Maybe more exposure to these friends will help him to understand that he is safe to be who he really is around them too.      The scheme that he proposed would mean the creation of this false impression of him to your friends that would need to be maintained. I think honesty is better, but maybe you could have said \"We will chip in for a third\" and then cover that whole third yourself. This way you seem united with him in front of your friends, and      he doesn't feel as an outsider to the group. The details of who pays back who between the two of you would obviously not need to be mentioned in the group setting.      He should put real effort into shedding his insecurities about the way he \"should\" be, but finding middle ground like this can help when he feels exposed or vulnerable.",

He wants your friends to think highly if him, to view him in a positive way, nit pity him because he doesn't earn as much.

We’ve both had to work on asking the other to cover certain parts of the bill if one can’t afford it all on their own.      The gesture of you offering to help cover it was good, and it says a lot about you. I think it also says a lot that you were looking out for him financially, saying that he realistically wouldn’t be able to cover part of that bill. But his excuse of it “emasculating” him is BS.

I would like to ask how often you go out and if it’s not too much, what the average cost of a date is.

If this means he offers to take you out to less expensive places and you elect to go to more expensive places only, then YTA.",

The anachronistic term for him is \"kept man\" and you are playing to type, and making sure everyone knows that you've got a kept man, even if nobody uses that term anymore.      Should he be emasculated? Absolutely. He can't afford to play in the world he's trying to play in. The only reason he is there is that you can afford to do so. He wants the men to think he belongs when he doesn't. While I can empathize with that, you have made it clear to him that part of the status of your relationship is that you will maintain the upper hand socially and economically, and he can accept it.      Ben is getting a bad rap, he should get HUGE credit. At 26 he had the emotional maturity to explain to you why this was hard on him and embarrassing. He has expressed what he needs to fit in your world (a bit of cover for his financial circumstances). To the people saying YTA, you're NOT being the AH, you are being you. They might think that you are always an AH, but you are just being you.      You have laid out the terms to Ben - he gets to go and enjoy expensive things he can't afford, he doesn't have to buy you things or do things for you, but he does have to be publicly emasculated by you for it so you can show off to your friends how generous you are \"dating down.\" That's the clear framework of your relationship. Ben can accept it or not.      He's no different than the wives of doctors/lawyers going out for lunch to an expensive place that their husband's incomes afford. His role is genderbent and therefore emasulating, and he can accept it or not.      I also live in a subculture in the US that functions that way. When the check arrives, generally the guys will split it. That includes the occasional guy that's solo. It includes the guy whose a tradesman or a teacher. As a rule, the women dont pick it up.      I have a credit card on my wife's business account so I can use it when we want to put something to a business expense (out with another couple that's a client) so I can grab the bill. It certainly just \"isn't done\" where the women pick up.      You can all scream and yell that this is outdated, but just consider the fact that there are millions of people out there that have different social values, and that's okay.      But this is great for Ben to know. If the relationship procedes, he will have to \"know his place\" his entire life.

Again, OP came here, because when she thought about it later, she most likely realized she would’ve wanted more support in her emotional position had the roles been reversed. A man feeling emasculated doesn’t just affect him, it affects the relationship.      Is it a big deal that he doesn’t make much money and she pays for things? Not at all. But that’s no one else’s business. She disregarded his feelings in public with barely a discussion, which means she emasculated him twice over.      It sounds like OP lives in a very protected bubble of entitlement because of her free money that she didn’t work for. It’s very common with people who didn’t earn their own wealth.",

You two need to clear the air and openly communicate how you feel and what your expectations are going forward.  Ask why he feels the way he does and assure him you couldn't care less about his financial situation.      You didn't emasculate him, he's a victim to the toxic masculinity game and it's all in his head.  You did nothing wrong, this is something he needs to figure out for himself.

I thought this was dumb, spiders pose zero threat to her, but I did it because I wanted her to be comfortable, and I respected her idiosyncrasies.

If however it was because he is embarrassed with his income and place in life I get it.      Ten years ago I went to dinner with family, about 15 people.      I had a certain amount of money and I ordered what I wanted.  My father said Is that all you're having? Order what you want it's OK.  I said no this is fine.      He then said if you don't have enough money and can't afford it I'll pay, get what you want.      Now I have severe social anxiety and already wasn't happy with my life.   I was struggling mightily and most of my family didn't know how bad and I didn't want them to know.  Eventually after saying I was fine multiple times and him insisting to pay and making me feel (unintentionally) horrible. I said I needed a minute to myself and stepped outside.      Of course people kept coming out to see if I was ok, and my anxiety got worse and worse despite telling them to give me 5 mins that I had a panic attack and ruined dinner.      Now obvious this is a different case completely but before you decide if what you did was OK or not figure out what triggered him.      Was it you, a woman paying for his food      You offering and so-called emasculated him      Or is he in general like that when anyone pays.      It sounds like the last vecause remember he didn't feel comfortable with the guys paying the bill either.      Sounds like he has a self esteem issue related to his money and it may not be about a woman paying.      Talk to him about it.  If it is about you paying well then he is being misogynistic but if it is for above reason perhaps he needs you to just talk to him about it and listen.  Don't tell him advice.

Its very easy to say you’re okay with a gap in wealth, its another to navigate that class divide. It may feel like nothing to you because you are in environments that you are used to. Your boyfriend is rocking a pretty hard imposter syndrome accompanying you. Many of the more expensive restaurants are supposed to feel exclusive- which to him makes him feel like he’s not supposed to be there. The fact that you and your friends are all at ease there doesn’t mean he is. Its probably the opposite, where everything he does is under intense scrutiny. And lets be honest, wealthy people can have a million ways they judge people, down to the materials your buttons are made from.      So when your boyfriend is doing something to save face with a white lie in an environment he feels very uncomfortable with and you cannot bear to back up your significant other, instead choosing to embarrass him further, it makes him feel like you don’t take his feelings or worries seriously or back him up on more important stuff if you’ll throw him under the bus for little stuff      This class divide stuff come mostly from my family where there is a big difference in wealth between sides of the family. My mother told me essentially that the first few years felt like she constantly needed to prove herself, whereas my stepdad had no clue why my mom and his family were so antagonistic. In many cases, his family didn’t even realize they were being judgemental, they were simply noticing things. So while growing up with this kind of wealth has made these things immaterial to you, to him, they are very important and you do not seem to respect the value they hold to him.",

I hope this comment can help      There were three guys at the table, Max, Harry, Ben, and of the three guys, Max and Harry paid, while the women and Ben were outside of it. Unfortunately, even in 2023, that absolutely can come off as emasculating.      My wife and I have been in your (as a couple) exact same shoes. My wife has a large trust fund and an Ivy league education. I absolutely felt a bit embarrassed because I did not have the means or the education to keep up with them. So my wife helped pick out new clothes for me, and let me know beforehand that she'd front me the money when we'd go out with her friends so I could be one of \"the guys\" and help pay. And I felt incredibly grateful for her, and it made it so that even though we had very different socio-economic statuses, I felt more comfortable coming into her world.      Now, ball is in your court of how you want to play this. Clearly this bothers you, so I don't recommend continuing on as is. Option one is break up, and find someone who makes more than your passive trust income.      Option two, work on yourselves. If you want to build a partnership with Ben and keep these friends, you need to help him adapt to the situation. Just because Harry and Max might not have expected him to pay doesn't mean that there might not be some judging going on behind the scenes, not to mention making Ben uncomfortable.      Also you say that it's hard for him to \"treat\" you because you're used to luxury. I'd recommend letting him know what would be a better \"Treat\" for you; maybe he can do an hour massaging you, or cleaning your place, cook for you, whatever floats your boat.      Ben needs to also accept that he makes less than you, but that doesn't need to make him lesser in your relationship. It's not fun in public to feel called out by that, but if you're doing things like treating him or what not, he should look to help contribute in other ways.      I hope this helps, good luck.

I just thought it was childish that he wanted to take credit and cause an unnecessary inconvenience for us later because he thought my friend were judging him, which they weren’t\"      YTA OP, and I'm going to tell you why.      I'm in the same position as you.  I make almost double what my partner makes.  I am a generous person.  While our relationship thrives on a 50/50 where we can, there are times it swings in my favour heavily, especially date nights.  We love live music.  We see a LOT of it.  But he can't keep up with me financially so I have treated him to a lot of a shows.      After several shows this year, he expressed that he felt bad he could not pay his fair share.  That he felt \"less of himself\" but at the same time, also grateful for my kindness and how sweet it was that I was a generous, loving person.  He struggles with vulnerability.  He and I both grew up in poverty, and have a very strong sense of pride in being able to \"get by on our own\".  We both struggle with asking for help.      We COMMUNICATED, which appears to be something you and your boyfriend are not doing.  I respect my partner's feelings, even if part of it is sadly rooted in society's toxic expectations that \"men provide\".  I expressed that money is not the only way we \"gift\" people.  His company, his support through a bad year, matters to me.  In our case, we're at his place more.  We use more of his food, place wear on his truck etc.  I noted that he incurs more costs that way and for me, it feels even, just different.  However, I also never want to HURT him.  So I agreed to always ASK IN ADVANCE before treating him, and to slow down a bit.  I also make an effort for us to go on dates where he CAN pay.      The way you describe this, this is a longstanding issue you have not addressed and you have dismissed his feelings as \"silly\" because \"I have money, who cares?\".  You took him out somewhere you knew he couldn't afford and assumed you'd pay, but did not clearly discuss this in advance.  I suspect this is something you do a lot.  Do you evenly go out with his friends?  Does he pay then?  Or do you pay sometimes even when it's a more affordable check for him with his social group?      While he needs to process and work on his feelings of being emasculated by a woman of means, he does feel insecure and has an issue that he tried to address to comfort himself in the moment (let me pay, pay me back later quietly).  He wanted to save face for himself - something you could have unpacked later.  After all, the net result still would have been you paying.  Instead, you ignored his discomfort as a partner, in a situation you created, and said,  \"I am not willing to do something to soothe you in this instance, provided we properly hash this out after dinner\".  You just went on ahead.      I don't like the lack of communication here.  I don't like the dismissive way you've noted how he feels you don't appreciate his attempts to treat you back.  I don't like your assumption it was a \"pissing contest\" with your friends.  I don't like that it feels like you two are not on the same page.  I don't like it because it doesn't seem that you've ever truly discussed anything about what Ben feels, wants or needs on a deeper level.      While his reasoning is rooted in beliefs that can and should be unpacked, and there's nothing wrong with you paying the bill more often, this feels like you avoiding his needs and a critical discussion.      Equality isn't equity.  Both of you need to discuss that.",

Person with more money gets the big bills, person with less gets the smaller things. Literally nobody cares. Some of the older friends we have “fight” over who treats the table, but it’s gender neutral and it’s not a big deal if you never do it. Us younger friends even make a show of avoiding the bill lol. So his feelings are absurd to me as well.      I understand being ashamed of not having money. I grew up poor and spent years with empty fridges and $20 to my name.

I’m sure you’d be called an asshole and to think about Ben’s feelings also.      BUT, you should’ve just said no and let the other guys pay for the table.

It does seem like Ben displayed some major insecurities in an unhealthy way, OP a lack of empathy and awareness, and the both of them need to work on communication, but this seems like a very human interaction that occurs in some form or another at some point or another in every relationship. Ben may be a misogynist, or maybe he comes from a patriarchal society in which certain social pressures are seemingly placed on men (and women), and while he rationally knows these expectations are wrong or outdated, in new social situations with people he wants to fit in with that rationality might go out the window and the lizard part of the brain takes over that says \"I must be like everyone else!\" People are irrational sometimes, and that's ok until it isn't. That's the tacit deal you make when you enter into a relationship.      Ben seems obviously insecure about the disparity in socioeconomic status/class, but he went into this situation thinking his gf would pay for him as she had done repeatedly over their 8-month relationship. When it became apparent that the guys were going to pay for everyone (significant others and friends) as they \"usually do\", it may have seemed to him that the social ground rules for this friend group was that men pay for women, and to fit in with this group he felt he had to comply, at least superficially. In case anyone was unaware, many people are really fucking weird about money and appearances, often driven by a family history of either poverty or overabundance, and even seemingly well-adjusted people can revert back to factory settings given the right circumstances. Was his reaction irrational? Of course, but perhaps understandable.      Then OP reasonably though this reaction was a desire to not have \"the guys\" pay for them, when really it was an attempt to fit in socially, so her solution was to offer to pay as well. Obviously this was the wrong solution given the problem, and felt to him as a further humiliation given his insecurities about their disparity in economic class. Ben was attempting to connect with people he felt disconnected from, and OP's reaction seemed to drive the point home that he didn't belong, at least in his mind. Was OP TA? No, I don't think so, but perhaps she doesn't have enough social context to understand why he might think the way he does. Was Ben TA?

Whether you agree with that norm or not I’d bet that’s part of it.      No one’s really an asshole. Just talk about it. Also, if he’s really that broke and wouldn’t haven been able to pick up third of the tab like you thought then you may wanna consider making different types of plans that don’t cost as much but to me it seems like that’s exactly what he’s trying to avoid in an attempt to blend with your lifestyle.",

I know more often than not, my husband could never afford to come up with the cash for a fancy dinner, and things like that. If it’s just the two of us, it’s no big deal whose card comes out to pay the bill since it’s coming out of our joint account, if we’re paying by cash, I slip it to him and let him pay. But I also know if I pick up the tab he does feel awkward. It’s a societal thing.      But if you’re in a group of all of your friends, and all of them are in a situation similar to yours, meaning of a higher financial status, think of the awkward position that put him in. He already knew going into that dinner, that he was going to feel like the man out i.e. not being able to afford his own meal, let alone yours and his or even part of a very large group. That whole experience was probably full of anxiety for him thinking about what happens when the bill comes.      And of course he was worried about losing face in front of you and all of your friends. You could have easily done the gracious thing, and given him cash beforehand to cover the bill, or told him I will absolutely pay you back so you can feel comfortable paying the bill. all it really takes, is a little bit of a conversation and being cognizant of your significant other and their feelings.",

        "Text": "Nobody's really an AH here, but also a soft ETA. This is a disconnect in cultural mindset. As a man, I can speak to what was going through your BF's mind.      Ben was raised to believe his social and romantic worth is in his ability to provide and offer. It's a sentiment I understand all too well and struggle with in my own way.      You have a different mentality that's pragmatic and matter-of-fact, so you don't see the point in maintaining outward social decorum. You call a thing what it is and leave it at that. In an ideal world, this is how it would be and nobody would sweat who's got what part of the bill, but we do not live in that world. We live in a world of increasingly conflicting and contradictory ideals.      t's a simple fact that men have their own wavelength that they communicate to each other on through gestures and actions, not words. It's the same with women. I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but it's still an unspoken assumption that if multiple couples get together for dinner, and multiple men then spring to split the check amongst themselves, if one of them doesn't also do this—or worse, let's his GF/wife pay his portion—he is lesser. It's a semi-non-verbal social economic exchange happening between the men that you, as a woman, are simply not included in, and Ben was thinking about it this way around.      Ben found himself in a Catch-22. Framing it as a \"pissing contest\" is the wrong way to look at it because that's not really what it is. Ben wasn't trying to puff up be bigger than Max and Harry. He was simply trying not to come off as a lesser man. I know this will sound sexist, but it's true. You're not a man, so man code is a foreign language to you.      Another thing to bear in mind is that out of 8 people, 7 (including you) were friends, and Ben was the odd one out. Ben probably wants to fit in with your friends because he cares about you, and therefore your friendships, so he was also feeling a more general social pressure to ingratiate himself by giving more than he took.      I think Ben's critical misstep was to frame it to you as that he would pay and you would pay him back. If he was going to make the offer, he should've eaten the cost. However, you countered with a critical misstep of your own. You could have just said that \"Ben and I will pay for our meals.\" What you said was you, yourself, would pay for a third of the dinner—that third presumably covering Ben's dinner as well, which I'm sure Ben could have afforded.      You didn't emasculate Ben because you wouldn't let him offer to chip in. You emasculated him by cutting straight past allowing him to at least pay for his own meal and offering to pay a whole third yourself. Ben may be being dramatic, but you're also undercutting him.      Be careful how you phrase your loved one's behavior to yourself and others because using argumentative language can easily lead to spite and loathing in a relationship. Using \"overdramatizing,\" \"he needs to get over himself,\" \"sulking,\" and \"pissing contest\" as ways of describing your BF's behavior to others is belittling of the man you love and who loves you, and you should take time to think of a scenario in which you had an irrational response to something and how you might feel if Ben went around saying, \"She was overdramatizing and sulking after trying to get in a pissing contest with her friends. I really think she needsto get over herself. She's childish.\"      There may be a seed of truth in these worda, but they're not helpful and can in fact be harmful. If Ben is truly any one of these things, why are you dating him? That's just a rhetorical question, but sit with it. The best way to move forward is to actually get mature together, stop framing things of \"who's the asshole,\" and discuss a game plan for future gatherings with your friends. For instance, a good thing to do before your agree to dinner with 7 other people is make sure Ben is comfortable going and able to pay for at least his dinner. If Ben wants to be able to chip in, give him good lead time to tuck away a few bucks to do that. Have a game plan for what to do when the bill comes to the table. Etc.      Good luck...",

Maybe something at such an unconscious level on their part - and therefore you - towards your boyfriend that you haven't noticed?      I'm not saying that your friends treat you badly, is it that a situation could have unintentionally arisen that would lead you to feel inferior in the economic sphere?      I will explain to you from my point of view      In my line of work I meet many people of really high socioeconomic status and I have had all kinds of interactions that dictate the extent to which I reach and accept in the interactions.      There are the types that are definitely openly passive aggressive, and others take away the passive, they go straight to aggressive.      There are others whose way of acting is natural, but they do not realize that they create an uncomfortable situation for those who cannot keep up with their expenses.      and there are those who are aware of your financial limitations and the activities are a middle ground, or at least they make you feel confident that you will not be humiliated and that it is a gesture of good faith to supplement expenses when you cannot keep up.      I know what I am and I know my value, but I don't accept invitations from certain people... I once overheard by accident a conversation from a person with whom we went to a work lunch where everyone paid their own share.      This person said: well, I thought he wasn't going to eat because she wasn't sure she could pay and we were going to finish paying for the food ourselves.      It was really humiliating.      Now every time I necessarily have a meal with that person, I pay for my meal.      Another case was that he was advising a company, but the company was in another city.      This company sent a car with a driver to pick me up and covered my food expenses.      Likewise, if he had to invite someone to lunch, he spoke directly to the president of the company and told him that it was necessary to invite these people (meetings that brought him many benefits, not only for this case, but also for later emergencies in other incidents. ), I just went and a representative of the company went and covered the cost, they NEVER gave me my money in cash for the expenses      Some time later, the representative of that company's government officials received a call by accident, unaware that his phone called me and I answered, he continued talking, I spoke loudly in case he heard so he could hang up, he didn't.      When I was going to hang up the call, he heard my name and out of curiosity I continued listening to the conversation.      They were proposing me for another project for that company and he said: no, it is very expensive... he said it in a derogatory and mocking way, alluding to the extra lunches and those initially scheduled, he also implied in other words why I was taking advantage of eat in those expensive restaurants because I couldn't do it myself... I wouldn't accept another project from that man for anything in the world, not even a coffee in the office, I'm professional and cordial, but I won't even give him water again. to accept      It was not the same with the president of the company, he was meeting with them and he scolded him about it, he told him many of the benefits he got from the people he presented to them at those lunches, they were only a few hundred compared to the thousands he would have had. to pay with a specialized public relations firm that would not achieve even a quarter of the progress that it achieved with me      and I finish with this ending      If she wanted to, if she were a little less honest than she is, how easy it would be for her to get deals (of the shady kind), and have money to even throw on the roof.      note: it's true      Now you understand? When I read your story I thought about the scene and how unnecessarily humiliating it was for your partner.      Dirty clothes are washed at home      How about allowing him to keep that little bit of dignity and then, at home, just the two of you arguing about whether his position was absurd or not?      because he thought it would be humiliating, and to specify something more than what was emasculating, to give you a real reason.      Without knowing the true facts you can't do anything about it, you're not a fortune teller, you don't read minds.      and explain to him why you didn't think it was humiliating for him.      Both of you must learn to live with the idea that you are the member of the couple with the highest income and a circle with a higher economic pace of life than his... something that could change through turns of life, they are in the first half of your 20s, god..sorry and I know this may sound condescending, but guys, you are just drying your milk mustache, there are many things in this life ahead of you in your futures and you BOTH need to learn from them      the greatest confidence      you, a little more empathy      Who knows, maybe at some point his professional life will skyrocket and he will even start earning more money than you.      sit down and talk about it, be open with each other's position, and if in the end you see that it is an insurmountable obstacle - because let's be clear, you should not lower your level of life for anyone -, at least your separation is amicable rather than due to an outburst. of one of the parts",

According to those set of rules thrown down, Ben was socially caught with either conforming or not, and bless him he tried to find a solution in the blink of an eye. I really feel for him.      It doesn’t really matter to whether you feel it didn’t matter, what matters is that the situation was very real, the rules very much established and Ben was left having to deal.      If your group had all played by the modern rules everyone would have paid for their own meal, or the bill would have been split evenly between the lot of you making it much cheaper, or you would have paid as a couple.  Ben would have probably been fine.  But damn it, the other men went old school and made socially conforming out of reach. Poor Ben.      YTA just because I feel for Ben, that would have sucked…",
