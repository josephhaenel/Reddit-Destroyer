Here are some French cars I like that are for sale in Hungary right now:  1988 Peugeot 505 - Manual - 124k miles / 200k km - $1900 / 690000 HUF - \"Call for information\"  1992 Peugeot 405 1.8TD SXD Turbo - 5 speed Manual - 198k miles / 318k km - $1100 / 380000 HUF - Daily driven. Paint has lacquer peel but interior and engine bay look minty.  1995 Peugeot 405 Break 1.9D GLXDT - 5 speed Manual - 202k miles / 326k km - $1000 / 350000 HUF - Body and interior both look great. Looks well cared for. I love the big stickers-- in case you forget what kind of car you're driving.  1997 Citroen XM 3.0 V6 24v - 5 speed Manual - 131k miles / 211k km - $4700 / 1690000 HUF - The car from Ronin! One owner V6 XM. Looks nice.  2000 Peugeot 406 SV 3.0 V6 24v - 5 speed Manual - 213k miles / 343k km - $1900 / 699000 HUF - The car from Ronin! Decent price for a V6 406.  2001 Peugeot 406 Coupe 3.0 V6 Pack - 5 speed Manual - 132k miles / 213k km - $3200 / 1150000 HUF - A decent price for a V6 406 Coupe. Got to love that Pininfarina body.  2002 Renault Avantime - 6 speed Manual - 127k miles / 205k km - $4400 / 1600000 HUF - Bold design from Patrick Le Quement that would set the direction for Renault in the 00's. Unfortunately, there wasn't a huge market for a pillarless 2+2 coupe that's the size and shape of a minivan.  2009 Renault Twingo RS133 - 5 speed Manual - 100k miles / 161k km - $4700 / 1699000 HUF - Good price for a 133. Note the 16\" wheels. These are actually somewhat rare on an RS. Most buyers opted for the cup chassis package, which included anthracite 17\" wheels. For a road car, the regular chassis and 16\" wheels are the cultured choice.  2009 Citroen C6 2.2 HDi Exclusive - 6 speed Manual - 173k miles / 279k km - $5100 / 1849000 HUF - The last goddess. This one has the rare-ish manual transmission only available with the 2.2L engine. Looks well kept.",
