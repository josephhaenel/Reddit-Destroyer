Whether they're strangers that just met or they've known each other for years, doesn't matter.      Also, logically speaking, being in a relationship with someone you've been friend for years is better and more meaningful than just dating someone you just known for a few months. And people feelings can change and develop. So that argument doesn't even make sense.",

Jordan has always kept information about his relationship status private, I'd imagine Kara is similar in that regard, and would certainly respect Jordan's wishes to keep such things private, so if they were together in that way, they'd never tell us, and they'd have no obligation to do so. Something some of both streamers' viewers need to just accept (I imagine the majority of viewers are respectful). Not to mention it's creepy and disrespectful to ship real life people just in general. Whatever they are, they should be left to it in peace, as we enjoy the content they provide us.",

Learning about them moving in together recently was really surprising.      Then again, my almost decade of watching Jardon has instead given me the impression of him being the most ace person I will ever see. Though that's the impression, the real deal is a whole other matter.      And because of my impression as written in the previous paragraph, I have never really cared about knowing whether the captain is in a romantic/sexual relationship with anyone, honestly. Sure, in terms of not harrassing people over \"ships\", I apply that to practically every creator I watch, but this principle is exceptionally strong with Jardon.      Like, asking why they decided to move in together, that in itself is not bad, cause IMO that's still kinda mindblowing even for the best of friends to move in together. But of course the issue arises when the shipping of real people starts.",
