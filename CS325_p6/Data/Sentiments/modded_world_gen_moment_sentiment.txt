Sentiment: neutral

Comment: 2131953663 is a pretty ordinary seed
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: it's heavily modded, but the seed is      3.1.2.64815364      i'd think the mods causing this might be      remnants, calamity, jerethejuggler's custom generation, and thalassophilia      it might work without calamity, and remnants. i'm not sure

Comment: Is that x‚âà|sin(y)| ?

Comment: Nope, there's a bit of randomization in it as well.

Comment: what
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: they're talking about how the shape of the abyss looks like the modulus of a sin(y) wave where the wave crosses the y axis instead of the x (it moves vertically instead of horizontally). a function inside a modulus (the | | part) means that it will convert all negatives to positive, meaning that the wave never actually crosses the axis, it just "bounces" off it. (e.g. |-3| = 3)
