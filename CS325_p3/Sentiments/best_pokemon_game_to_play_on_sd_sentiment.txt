Comment: You should check out Pokémon ROM hacks. I'm playing through Pokémon Unbound, and it's awesome.I just installed Emudeck that comes with emulators for all Nintendo system (and others). The handheld emulators work out of the box (maybe DS need bios files, I don't remember), otherwise just download your roms, place it in a folder and you're good to go.
