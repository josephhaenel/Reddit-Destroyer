Comment: You should check out Pok√©mon ROM hacks. I'm playing through Pok√©mon Unbound, and it's awesome.I just installed Emudeck that comes with emulators for all Nintendo system (and others). The handheld emulators work out of the box (maybe DS need bios files, I don't remember), otherwise just download your roms, place it in a folder and you're good to go.

Comment: The DS BIOS files are optional, but I think without them they don‚Äôt complete the experience

Comment: Has pokemon unbound different language support. My wife has played every pokemon game and I think she would be happy about new fodder, but her english is not up there and that kills the fun for her

Comment: How do you download and find roms? I must be the only person that can‚Äôt seem to figure it out. I have GBA and ps3 games but have no clue how to put them on emu deck. It‚Äôs like the only piece of any online instruction that isn‚Äôt clear- how to obtain roms
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: Romhacks/fan games! I‚Äôm playing Pok√©mon Unbound and Infinite Fusion now, and they‚Äôre both incredible. Unbound is a romhack, so you just put it with your regular gba roms. IF is a Windows program, so I just placed the files in my games folder and added the exe as a non-Steam game.Both have a lot of cool features and mechanics you won‚Äôt find in official Pok√©mon games, like the ability to fuse any two Pok√©mon into a new unique mon in IF.Edit: and for emulators,don‚Äôt overthink it. Just install Emudeck and call it a day.

Comment: Pokemon Emerald RogueBasically a roguelike version of pokemon, runs are usually a few hours to finish.Very addictive üòµ‚Äçüí´

Comment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZP4UEUWS9g imo Pok√©mon Luminescent, modders pretty much remade Pok√©mon Renegade Platinum for the switch using Pok√©mon Brilliant Diamond. https://www.youtube.com/@LumiTeam recommend checking out their channel and discord . Runs really nice on the SD using Ryujinx and emudeck

Comment: Pokemon Conquest, an underrated gem
Sentiment: positive

Comment: I‚Äôve been playing Pok√©mon Diamond through the DeSmuMe (I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called, and it‚Äôs not the 2015 version) through Retroarch since that‚Äôs what Emudeck has for DS Emulation
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: I've found pokemmo really great on the deck overall, takes a few roms and a tiny bit of setup but really rad take on classics, plus mods of stuff which makes it a bit more challenging!
Sentiment: positive

Comment: Surprised it took so long to find someone else mentioning PokeMMO, definitely recommend looking into it, especially if you have other people to play with, though the forced internet connection to play may not be the best fit for the Deck.

Comment: Nintendo would like to know your location, they are extremely unhappy you are having fun not on Nintendo hardware.      Also Nintendo: Did you know Nuzlockes are illegal?      xD

Comment: Pokemon infinite fusions it's fanmade but so good. Highly recommend it
Sentiment: positive

Comment: I would say red/blue, crystal/gold, and emerald/ruby but that's really the only ones I played.      Wouldn't say they're worth playing on the deck you can play them on your phone and that's a more suitable enviorment for that imo.
