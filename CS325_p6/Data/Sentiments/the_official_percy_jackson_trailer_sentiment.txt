Comment: is this them giving the movies another shot? i thought they did this once already and it came out mids. shame because these books were some of my favorites as a kid
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: They are doing it as seasons not movies so they have time to actually develop the stories. Also Rick Riordan is an executive producer on the show
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: Why not make annabeth a dude at this point. Looks promising but just stick to the book
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: fr imagine if the roles were reversed and they made myles morales white in the movie or something.  it would be pandemonium and everyone would get fired lmao

Comment: Comic Book movies are different since there is numerous incarnations of Spidermen/superheroes in the comic books rather than just Peter Parker. Miles is a fully fledged character who's heritage is important to the character so if they wanted someone white they could to with Ben Reily for example.      Or Silk or Spider Gwen for a female version.
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: Miles Morales’s character is based on him being black and the heritage that comes with it. this is not comparable.

Comment: They could have even bleached her hair blonde and it still would’ve gone along with it. Sigh. The rest looks pretty solid with the source material but idk why they would overlook that detail again for a PC casting
Sentiment: negative

Comment: Rick is the one that chose her.  If you have a problem with that, go to the author.

Comment: Shhh dont bring logic into this

Comment: Lol it’s so crazy how these people are.

Comment: That just means Rick is now woke, I still say stick to the OG book. These changes simply tell me they could change anything in the story and there is absolutely ZERO chance this show is a better story than the book. Name one piece of entertainment based off something else where the content was changed and it actually did better than the OG. I’m not hating just yet but it’s a bad sign      TLDR: changes tell me this show will probably suck somehow
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: You lost any kind of argument once you claimed Rick is “woke”.
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: Now woke lol. As though the books aren't filled with lgbt and poc representation.      P.s. how is changing someone's race changing anything actually vital to the plot? Aside from mentioning her hair colour, her being white plays no role in the story...

Comment: Then that would mean Percy would be gay and all hell would break loose

Comment: Why isn't raceswapping characters considered racist yet? It involves seeing the original race of a character as "problematic", judging actors based on race, heavily favoring one race over the other, and, unrelated to racism, spreads conflict and makes the film maker look desperate by pandering to the pc crowd. It also shows a lack of ability to create new franchises with new, interesting characters of varying races, and it's disrespectful to the original story and writer. Just getting kinda frustrating.
Sentiment: negative

Comment: Then maybe you should consult with the author? Rick chose her to play Annabeth. He said she portrayed the character the best. He said he is allowed to change the appearances of his own characters.
Sentiment: positive

Comment: Why does it matter what race these characters are? It’s not really important to their stories.

I wish Reddit wouldn't be so blatantly putting ads to our face without calling it what it is, a promoted post by the site. They make it look like people are going crazy for this when you barely have any presence here, yet it is at the top of the Popular page. This is not a naturally growing post, its a fucking Ad.
