Comment: Welcome to r/AmITheAsshole. Please view our voting guide here, and remember to use only one judgement in your comment.      OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:      I might be the asshole because Ben is obviously upset and hurt and I don’t want him to feel bad about spending time with my friends in the future over this. Maybe it was a case of just letting him have his way even if it was stupid      Help keep the sub engaging!  Don’t downvote assholes!    Do upvote interesting posts!

Comment: Nta! And it sounds like he didn’t have the money to afford it, and he just didn’t know how to tell you. Super weird.
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: I knew he didn’t though, and he said I could pay him back later. Like, if he’d paid he would have been relying on me transferring him back the money. So why go through the extra step when I could just pay
Sentiment: negative

Comment: Him feeling emasculated by not having the money and having to ask you for it plus being emasculated by you making it obvious in front of his friends was probably probably just a bad mix and that’s why he was sulking and upset- but it’s important you know that none of them are your issue lol. If you work for your money, then you are 100% in the right to want people to know that you’re paying with your money and not somebody else’s. If your man doesn’t have enough money in the bank to cover a couple friends in case of a situation like this/split the bill when you go out with a group, then he really shouldn’t be going out to eat.
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: All my money is someone else’s, I inherited it.      But I invited him to the dinner knowing I was going to pay for him if we split it. It’s an expensive restaurant that he wouldn’t otherwise choose to go to, and it’s dinner with my friends, I had no issue paying. I just thought it was childish that he wanted to take credit and cause an unnecessary inconvenience for us later because he thought my friend were judging him, which they weren’t

Comment: If your man doesn’t have enough money in the bank to cover a couple friends in case of a situation like this/split the bill when you go out with a group, then he really shouldn’t be going out to eat.      Does this also apply to women?
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: Does this apply to women? Yes
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: If his girlfriend has the money and is willing to pay for him to go out, there is no problem with him going out to eat. The issue here is entirely the misogyny in his mindset and the fact that he's trying to get OP to play along with it. He's asking her to lie to her friends and pretend that he has money because he thinks men should make more money and pay for the women in their lives, and if he can't do that, he's not a man. It's a toxic mentality and asking OP to do the actual monetary work while giving him the credit because he thinks he deserves it more than her because of his genitalia, is absurd.

It's OK to go out to eat ... but he shouldn't try to maintain a fiction that he's paying.
Sentiment: negative

Comment: Her friends.      Did you read the original post at all?      Seems like Ben is intimidated hanging out with OP and her circle, who maybe are on similar career footing but different financial levels at the  moment.      Boyfriend wants to keep the fact that he doesn’t have it a secret because he wants to appear to be able to take care of OP. He thinks that is what makes a man.
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: He doesn't have to not go to dinner just because he can't afford it if his partner is more than willing to pay. He just needs to get over himself and understand the economic dynamics at play. Hell I'd love to have a better off partner that's willing to pay for me to do nice things
Sentiment: negative

Comment: How could she help but make it obvious? Bf said he didn’t want the two men paying, so how else was payment going to get resolved?
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: It’s even worse because it was her friends
Sentiment: negative

Comment: My wife doesn't have the money to cover her bill when we all go out to eat, so I make my wife stay at home when I go out.
Sentiment: negative

Comment: He is going out to eat somewhere he can’t afford because his girlfriend already promised to cover him. But yeah he behaved badly about it. He should just stay quiet or say thank you and let others pay if he’s not going to pay.
Sentiment: neutral

When someone is in a relationship with someone they love, they're supposed to support and protect that person and their feelings.  Her swinging her big dick around, "I'm paying so I'm telling everyone I'm paying" is a total dick move and completely uncalled for.      If neither of you see hurting someone, even for a slight you don't understand, as no big deal, you'll find someone who thinks the same way.
Sentiment: negative

Comment: You keep bringing up excellent points and op keeps sharing more and more info that goes against you and makes her yta
Sentiment: positive

Comment: Why just her man, and not the women of the group too? The streets can keep you, ma’am.

Sentiment: positive

Comment: He's 24... it's not like he's 40 lol cut the kid a break jesus
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: I don't know why we're bagging on him for being another victim of the patriarchial society. Like people think it's just something that oppresses women, but it oppresses everyone. Society tells him he should be ashamed for not being able to pay, and didn't know how to reconcile that, and is probably getting frustrated trying to articulate why he feels negatively about the situation.      Pointing the finger at him and laughing at him for being upset about this feels weird.
Sentiment: positive

Comment: What a toxic take. "Your date's feelings aren't your problem."      "Then he really shouldn't be going out to eat" such weird assessments you're trying to make about this guy. I feel like if the sexes were reversed, you'd have the entirely opposite opinion.
Sentiment: negative

Comment: If the op doesn't care but their s.o. does - does that not change the nature of what one SHOULD do in this situation (less about what they have the right to do more about what would be the good thing to do)      Eg- I never gave a f about how much work around the house I might do, and never gave a f about my ex taking credit for maintaining the house as if she did so on her own/ it ment nothing to me to let her have that little victory to make herself feel good - but would have made her feel like straight ass for no productive cause if I chimed in every time to make sure her friends knew I did the laundry or maintained the floors or what have you.      Similarly, if the op does not care either way---- then all they've done is hurt their s.o. because they CAN.      Would anyone here accept that behavior from their s.o.? I know I wouldn't
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: What? You can't go out to eat if you can't afford to pay for other peoples' food? I strongly disagree - but if you can't afford to pay for anyone you have to be comfortable with saying you want to split the bill, and unless people insist, not have them pay for your food when you won't be able to reciprocate.
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: You don’t sound like a very caring person tbh. Very cold
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: “Not her issue’s “doesn’t excuse her from having some consideration for the person she is with. Instead of saying “ don’t even worry about it” or discreetly handing him the money. , she made a spectacle of herself and her date.
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: I think you need to ask him point blank, “is me having more money than you going to be an issue? Because this has come up a few times now and I’m over it. I don’t care that you make less money than me but I DO care that you’re acting like a whiny brat about it. We live in the 21st century. Men’s worth isn’t tied to their bank account. If you think yours is, you need to work on it without me because I am not going to tolerate someone who is trying to act like a big man just because I make more money.”      I know it’s harsh, but frankly, we all know the answer already and I have a suspicion he’s going to get REALLY aggressive when he replies, and I think you need to figure out just what sort of man he really is sooner rather than later so you stop wasting your time on this dude. No one cares that he’s poor. We care that he’s acting like a jealous kid.
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: I completely agree with the idea of your comment, but      We live in the 21st century. Men’s worth isn’t tied to their bank account      Let's be honest, that's the goal but we're still very far from it.
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: If this is your reaction to one partner expressing an insecurity, I wouldn’t want to be your partner.  I wouldn’t put someone down for being insecure, I’d rather help them through it.
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: I mean, I agree that she should ask, but maybe approaching it with a bit less hostility than you suggest might be helpful.      Men's worth isn't tied to their bank accounts.      Theoretically true, in practice it can really go either way. I've known people that couldn't care less, and I've known people for which that's the only thing that matters (I'm talking all sexes and genders here).
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: Soo be a complete asshole and super confrontational in stead of politely and calmly stating all of that?
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: You can absolutely say this calmly, but yes. When you are confronted with a very likely dealbreaker, I think you need to address the issue head on and be very clear about the fact that certain behavior is unacceptable to you. Too many women dance around an issue and are too afraid to be blunt and direct. That doesn’t solve anything.
Sentiment: positive

Comment: seriously he needs to get over his insecurities, but its only been 8 months. Id cut my losses at this point. NTA op
Sentiment: negative

Comment: She doesn't 'make more money'. OP has stated that she didn't earn her money. It was inherited.
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: And apparently has a lot of her expensive meals paid for by her rich male friends.
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: Exactly. He feels “emasculated” because of financial reasons,, sounds like an a-grade loser
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: Asking the question, yes. without the anger and threats though.
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: I agree with this to an extent. Maybe even some encouragement to better himself too. Get an education. ( Now, I say that. But, my education is in trade schools. And I do very well now. But, it's taken quite a while to be where I am now. And I did not go to a formal college either. I didn't want all the student debt.)
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: tbh none of this OP’s job. if the bf feels that his worth is tied to money, that’s fine and he should just not date women who make more than him. simple. he can figure things out himself rather than pushing his insecurities onto OP.
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: I know it’s harsh, but frankly, we all know the answer already and I have a suspicion he’s going to get REALLY aggressive when he replies      Relax.
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: This has never furthered any discussion ever. In fact it serves the opposite more often than not.
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: I don’t mean violently, and I understand my wording was vague. I simply mean I think he’s going to be very harsh in his words and try to make OP out to be the bad guy, emasculating him etc etc. and like I said, that comes down to sexism and not being able to handle being the “less successful” one as a man. Fuck that noise.
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: Long-term this probably won't last. This level of insecurity around finances usually turns into unnecessary aggression because you have what you rightly earned and they don't. They begin to act like your achievements were done to spite them or somehow they hold them back. I can't and won't date a man that makes less than me. Not because I want their money but because I don't want to be abused in a relationship because I do have money.
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: she said in another comment that she doesn't earn her money - its inherited. dunno if that changes your pov.
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: Not even remotely.
Sentiment: negative

Comment: This was a real stretch. Op also stated she inherited everything she has she never claimed she earned any of it. She's nah but you could have a little empathy. It's not always as easy to be a man in society as you may think. These types of judgments that he's afraid of are very real and still extremely common. He needs to get past it but we help those we love we don't turn our backs on them because of some weakness. Strength is developed it isn't inherent. You have the right to date anyone you want , but you're kind of an asshole.
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: His only problem is jealousy and insecurity. There is nothing OP can do about that except wire transfer all her money to him, and he still would probably call her emasculated.      Whether she earned it or her great grandfather struck gold, she has a right to a partner who loves her and whose manhood isn't dependent upon him having more in the bank.
Sentiment: positive

Comment: yep same. learned that one the hard way with my first bf. he was so insecure ab it and then became so spiteful about it. i told my younger siblings “dont take someone not in your general income bracket” bc it turns awful and you also are use to having very different lifestyles
