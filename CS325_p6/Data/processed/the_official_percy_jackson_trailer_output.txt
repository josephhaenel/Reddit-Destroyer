These changes simply tell me they could change anything in the story and there is absolutely ZERO chance this show is a better story than the book. Name one piece of entertainment based off something else where the content was changed and it actually did better than the OG. I’m not hating just yet but it’s a bad sign      TLDR: changes tell me this show will probably suck somehow",

It involves seeing the original race of a character as \"problematic\", judging actors based on race, heavily favoring one race over the other, and, unrelated to racism, spreads conflict and makes the film maker look desperate by pandering to the pc crowd. It also shows a lack of ability to create new franchises with new, interesting characters of varying races, and it's disrespectful to the original story and writer. Just getting kinda frustrating.",
