I got a picture but a bunch of people got videos. Definitely not a rocket. It sat in place for a few minutes then just slowly floated off. The light was like a floodlight in the front not coming from the back. I didn't see it appear but other accounts claim the circle appeared and the craft came out of it. I just looked up to see it sitting still in front of the hole for a while then flew away in a way that reminded me of a submarine under water in a animated movie.
