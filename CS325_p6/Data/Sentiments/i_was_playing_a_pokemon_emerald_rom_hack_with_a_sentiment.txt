Comment: To be fair it was randomized.      The only mon that should have Radiance is Mega Lanturn      It would normally have theses abilities

Comment: For anyone asking, the ROM is Elite Redux. I believe there is an Elite Redux site you can use to patch an Emerald ROM.
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: I love Elite Redux. I need to try the randomizer though cuz I've only played the base game most of the way through and got kinda bored
Sentiment: positive

Comment: the randomizer is crazy as fuck, some pokemon get busted like OP's OP Delphox or you get something that becomes a brick because 1/4 abilities rolled Imposter and its on one of the 3 abilities you can't change.

Comment: Once you get a Huge Power Slaking with Multiscale and Speed Boost even Arceus wouldn't dare to anger you

Comment: Exactly, Kecleon with both Colour change AND Protean with leftovers, substitute and toxic is busted and can sweep through almost any team except the E4

Comment: Is it in-game randomizer or you need universal randomizer?

Comment: Four Abilities?
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: It's the rom hack pokemon elite redux it has 4 abilities
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: idk what the creator was thinking considering how extremely overboard that is. theres also lack of theming consistency, like why tf does a pyromancer witch has an ability to boost water type moves?
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: It doesn't op randomized abilities and innates
Sentiment: negative

Comment: Delphox's normal "inates" in this romhack are:      Blaze - Buffed to always increase fire moves by 20%, and by 50% when below 1/3rd hp.      Pyromancy - Fire moves burn 5x more often.      Psychic Mind - Psychic moves do 25% more damage.      So every Delphox always has all three of those and then on top of that, for abilities it has the choice of 1 of these 3:      Immolate - Normal type moves become fire type and have a 10% power boost      Neuroforce - Super effective moves are 25% stronger      Magic Guard - Regular magic guard      This Rom hack's philosophy definitely seems to be "make everything OP, so that nothing is". There'll be a huge amount of team variety in there, and it will definitely be information overload for a lot of people, but I can imagine it would be pretty fun for a lot of people too.

Comment: Give Delphox Beads of Ruin‚Ä¶
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: this would be really good with choice scarf too, as you get the sp.atk boosts from grim neigh anyway. Its base speed (104) is pretty good but there are some things that outspeed, also since delphox is modest and not timid that means some jolly/timid pokemon will outspeed. Still extremely busted though, nice find.
