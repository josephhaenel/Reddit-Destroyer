On which I do agree - the developer or the publisher should not use the terms interchangeably, but should be clear about what to expect.      A remaster should just be upscaled textures, maybe higher polygon count assets, and maybe a few quality of life changes (e.g.updated chemes or taking out gameplay elements that are outdated or tedious). Other than that, the game should represent the original as closely as possible in all other aspects.      A remake is taking an old game as inspiration, but then rebuilding it using modern tools, assets and design philosophies, and possibly expanding on the core content of the game (such as the gameplay loop, the story, the control-scheme, and more).      Take the FF VII remake as a perfect example. Yes, it's FF VII once again but literally almost everything else about it has changed. Even the story, as it seems we're now in some sort of alternate timeline.      If, at the game awards, they'd objectively assess what category a game falls into (despite a possibly faulty naming convention by the developer/publisher) then that'd be fine.      E.g. if the gameplay overhaul in Homeworld Remastered is so broad that it wholly changes the way in which the game is played, then it could be nominated in the \"Best Remake\" category, rather than only being eligible for a \"Best Remaster\" award or so (if they ever do create these separate categories)",

It's a 1:1 recreation of Wonder Boy 3: The Dragon's Trap, in a brand new engine designed to play exactly the same as the original but obviously with completely new graphics and music, but you can swap to 8 bit graphics on the fly.  However even though it looks exactly like the original 8 bit game underneath, it isn't actually the original game underneath, they remade it in a new engine.  I think I argued it was a remaster since it's 1:1 the same exact game and they said it was a remake since they literally had to remake the entire game, but I can see both sides honestly.  It's like yes technically it's a remake, but this should be categorized as a remaster, right?  And yeah this is where you realize there's no real, official definition of this sort of thing.  And if a particular game award show came up with a definition, it would be their own definition, and just that.

The Thing from 1980 and The Thing from 2011 aren't the same movie. Every scene is new, every voice line is new, even if the plot is similar. Remastering a movie that was released on VHS to have a Blu-Ray release, well that's still the same movie. Even if you toss in a deleted scene or two.

So the remake removed that section, mechanically, and redid the ADS cannons with completely new mechanics.

The coolest part was that the remake embraced the power difference between 7th and 9th gen consoles. The lighting system is much more robust, so the spaceship full of monsters is much darker and more reliant on your flashlight (they even added a section where you need to power an elevator by diverting power from either the lights or life support, making you rely on either your suit's tiny flashlight or tiny air canister), and what used to be a series of discreet levels is now seamless and with more backtracking to take advantage of it.",

The release still uses the PS3 original as a base but really overhauls and adds quite a bit.

Caring too much about this stuff is a sickness but being so detached from awards stuff for games or movies makes you forget that it’s actually good for the medium to celebrate the art form.

The story is pathetic and was written by a 5 year old. And the dungeons... those were just insulting. How the hell does wind waker, a game that looks even more kid friendy, have harder dungeons? Also there were barely any new enemies.      Can't complain about the gameplay though, that was fun.",

I think you vastly underestimate the amount of work and care that goes into these kinds of remakes. It's not even close to a reskin, it's a completely new game that borrows some aspects like story and setting from the old one, but still has to implement everything from scratch / in a completely new engine, create entirely new art, create or update game mechanics that please both the old fans as well as the current generations of gamers, etc.      A lot of things can still go wrong and there's still considerable risk involved. Do people even WANT a remake? Will they be happy with this one? Will it be deemed worthy or be seen as a quick cash grab? History is full of lackluster or downright failed remakes and remasters. Don't even need to look far: Resident Evil 3 remake sure looked pretty, but failed to live up to expectations after RE2 on many levels, e.g. by leaving out tons of content.      Or Warcraft III Reforged, Secret of Mana, Silent Hill HD Collection, Conker: Live and Reloaded, XIII, etc.      Doing a remake of a classic is not a guaranteed slam dunk at all.",

That's the only relevant distinction and all the other stuff people go on about like \"remaster exclusively improves the graphics while remakes make other changes to story and gameplay\" are total and utter nonsense.      Demon's Souls on PS5, for example, is a remake despite being only a graphical improvement, while Skyward Sword HD on Switch is a remaster despite containing quite a lot of changes other than the graphics. Why? The latter is based on the original source code, the former isn't (instead being a ground-up reconstruction of the original).",

Naughty Dog relating to their work in TLOU Part 1 as a remake doesn't ultimately matter.      The bar for a bona-fide remake would typically be more aligned to a re-imagining, more substantive and less strictly focused on visual fidelity upgrades, which rules out TLOU Part 1.      TLOU Part 1 is very similar in scope to eg. Metroid Prime Remastered, where there's a pretty significant asset overhaul but zero or almost zero gameplay changes.

They could have even remade the game with the goal of making the result look exactly the same as the original rather than an update. There'd be no reason for them to do that, but still, in that case, it would still be a remake.

I’d still be fine with these being disqualified since the new content could practically be an expansion/DLC      But then there are games which are pretty much just inspired by the original but are complete overhauls with different gameplay, level design, story changes that just tries to keep the spirit of the original. Games like this are the Recent Resident Evil Remakes starting with RE2, or games like Final Fantasy VII Remake. Games like this should absolutely still have a chance to get Game of The Year.",
