Comment: Switch the Monkey Paw and the Ouija Board and I'm all for this
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: Also switch mirror and cards and I'm all for this as well
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: What's the best thing about the ouija board? I thought it was mainly just to ask where the ghost is or to play hide and seek
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: Getting the ouija board on a big map is great because you could ask for the room, for the bone, maybe it’s age
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: Easy to confirm Thaye with it
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: How do you confirm Thaye? Will the age change or something?
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: I really only use cursed possessions for a controlled drain of sanity to initiate a hunt on my terms.  What’s the strategy with the monkey’s paw?
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: “I wish for knowledge”
Sentiment: positive

Comment: Does this always start a hunt? Because it has for my group every time but just wasn’t sure if we were unlucky, still super valuable even if we lose a team member tbf
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: guarenteed cursed hubt plus blindness/deafness

Comment: Or, in the case of my friend group, “I wish for life.” I swear we’re only kind of idiots, but we’re also usually drunk for Phasmo night lol
Sentiment: positive

Comment: I usually act on the brink of tears, barely sobbing out the words "I wish my friend was alive" to make it more dramatic.
Sentiment: negative

Comment: i mean thats cool and all but instant hanged man then high priestess is probably the most fun thing you can have happen to you
Sentiment: positive

Comment: Aside from knowledge, it’s great for finding the ghost room and the fact that it only triggers a regular hunt is great
Sentiment: positive

Comment: It's also the only item that can get you out of a (non-cursed) Hunt by wishing to Leave. It slows you down but Unlocks all the exit doors.
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: “I wish the ghost was trapped” locks the door to the ghost room and starts a hunt a minute later. It doesn’t cost sanity or anything. “I wish for sanity” sets all players sanity to 50% sanity and can change the ghost room. It doesn’t cause cursed hunts because the ghost doesn’t hunt from the wish
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: You can also revive friends at the 50% risk of dying immediately.
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: Favorite to least favourite      Tarot cards (I can revive my friend)      Monkey paw (I can revive my friend but might kill me)      Music box      Ouija board      Summoning circle      Voodoo doll      Mirror (boring as hell)

Comment: Last night my buddy who paid for the loadout. Sacrificed himself in order to bring me back so I can get the xp. I just prestiged lmfao
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: Oof. Their sacrifice will not be forgotten 😂
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: Lmfaoo he's like. This is probably gonna be stupid and get me killed. But you've done it for me. Hahahaha I thanked him
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: Mirror is reliable and it makes finding the ghost easy. Sometimes it’s annoying trying to find the room so I’ll never complain about getting it
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: Switch the music box with the mirror & the voodoo doll with the summoning circle n I agree
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: The tarot cards can also kill you.
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: Yes but the chances are smaller. Hang man is 1%. In my 1 year+ of playing, i got it less than 5 times
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: True, but the resurrection is 2% soo it's not that significant also.
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: Fair enough
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: Am I just an outlier in that I don't really like the Monkey Paw?
Sentiment: negative

Comment: Nah, I put it at the bottom of my list.
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: it punishes you for using any aspect of it
Sentiment: negative

Comment: Something that is guaranteed to be a bad time in exchange for information you can get by simply playing the game normally is not worth it to me. Revive is the only thing in it thats good imo and even then being a 2-man group, the trade isnt worth while if I die bringing someone back, what was the point
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: For me it's not even close to right      1 Tarot cards, my beloved      2 Mirror      3 Paw      4 Summon circle      5 voodoo doll      6 Ouija board      7 Music box
Sentiment: negative

Comment: I loveee the board on large maps since I can ask where the bone is. Usually also followed by googling a layout, because Women’s Room 69 means nothing to me
Sentiment: positive

Comment: I dislike the board simply because when you get it with random people, they always ask stuff that isn't important like "how old are you". Draining their sanity and causing hunts earlier      But the distaste goes both ways because for some reason, the first 2 years of the game being out, the board just did not work for me. Spirit box and everything else works fine but never got a single reply from the board. One time I literally just went in, found the board and tried to get a reply for about 30 minutes before just giving up. Works fine now but yeah
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: How old are you is good for immediately identifying a thaye, if it’s a thaye the age will change over the duration of the contract

Comment: StrikingClassroom141 is willing to throw punches and berate the devs and other people here in a public forum but as soon as someone replies to them they immediately delete their posts, avoiding any criticism. Striking called the Dev’s “pussies” for not abiding by their needs.      Once again. Peer deeply into the Haunted Mirror, you’ll certainly find that “pussy” you’re referring to is in-fact you. Get help.      Highly recommend the mods ban this clown from this subreddit.      (for those that want context look at the very bottom of this thread, few deleted posts and many downvotes)

Comment: circle: free ghost pic      mirror: controlled sanity manipulation      music box: scary ghost pic      ouija board: where are you = 50 sanity      tie: tarot and doll - too rng heavy

Comment: I put all my cursed items in order of the easiest way to kill my friends or randoms lmao. Love the music box for that.
Sentiment: negative

Comment: i use monkey paw with text and its hilarious
Sentiment: positive

Comment: Tarot card roulette always fun
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: It's cool to see the diversity in answers.  I love mirror more than anything else because it makes games so fast.  ouija is good too but idk what half the rooms are called on the big maps.
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: I'll be honest with you, I am a fan of all cursed possessions that allows me to take the ghost photo on demand and also drop my sanity to trigger a hunt on demand. Summoning Circle is my favorite because it does just that. I don't need to know where the ghost / bone is because I can find them on my own. I don't play on big and medium maps because I found them a waste of time and when I do, I make sure I have an ouija board and some strong sanity pills.
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: Summoning Circle is MVP, you can finish so many objectives with it. "Take a photo of the ghost, witness a ghost event, prevent a hunt using a crucifix" is a favourite combo of mine when I have summoning circle.
Sentiment: positive

Comment: I’ve never used it since a few times when cursed objects come out - it almost always seems to result in somebody getting killed! How are people escaping it once it’s loose?
Sentiment: negative

Comment: Idk how to use any of them without dying 😭
Sentiment: negative

Comment: My personal ranking is Tarot > Ouija > Mirror > Paw > Circle > Box > Doll. Not necessarily how good they are, just how much I like them
Sentiment: The sentiment of the comment is neutral.

Comment: My first monkey paw was.. ahhh. I asked to see the ghost then wished for safety. It did not save me 😭 I screamed my heart out. I thought I would be safe lol
