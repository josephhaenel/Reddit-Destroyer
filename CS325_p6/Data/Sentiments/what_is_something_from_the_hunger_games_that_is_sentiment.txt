Comment: Idk about ignored, but the whole thing with victors being sold into prostitution after the Games was pretty disturbing to me.      Also the Capitol avoxes.
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: Honestly‚Ä¶like that‚Äôs by definition sex trafficking, but I‚Äôm guessing the author probably wanted to avoid that word considering the books are supposedly meant for teenagers
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: First thing I thought of was Finnick mentioning it when he was used as a distraction while they rescued Peetaüò≠
Sentiment: negative

Comment: Yeah, in my opinion, this was pretty glossed over in the films and I really understood Finnick‚Äôs story reading more about THG world after watching the movies.
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: This is also what happened to Johanna but she said no. So Snow killed everyone she cared for bc of it.  Hence her line in Caching Fire "they cant hurt me, there's no one left I love"     Witch also makes her character make more sense. She has nothing left to lose
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: The probably still raped her or even if she was coerced, they still killed her loved one because she was defiant.
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: True we are never fully told the story.   And what makes it worse is Finnick mentions how ppl would apologize and offer him gifts bc they felt bad about it (that's how he ends up getting all his secrets).  So at least most of them knew to some extent that he was being forced and still would go thru with it
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: That‚Äôs the first thing I thought of when I read this title. ‚ÄúHey, congratulations on winning a traumatizing battle to the death. Now, have sex with these people who bought you or we‚Äôll kill your loved ones.‚Äù
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: When I first read that in the book about Finnick, I had to stop reading because I was so shocked. I should have assumed it was possible, with how Snow was shown to have operated at that point in the books, but it was still stunned me that he forced certain Victors to basically be sex slaves to the capitol.
Sentiment: negative

Comment: I'm going to go one further with that - children are sold for prostitution, they are children and that win. Finnick was 14
Sentiment: negative

Comment: 14 and had one of the most expensive sponsor gifts in the history of the games. The capitol wanted him to win.
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: It's such a weird form of grooming - you know that expensive gift was used like a 'i saved your life you owe me'
Sentiment: negative

Comment: Holy shit, I might be real dense for getting this only now, but I always thought the people of capitol sponsored the ones they wanted to win like people wanting horses to win races or something like that. But to think it might also be that they want a specific tribute to win because they can buy them after they‚Äôve won‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm speechless rn.
Sentiment: positive

Comment: Once you put certain pieces of information together or have it pointed out to you it's hard to unsee right? I feel sorry for Finnick more than anyone else in the series.
Sentiment: positive

Comment: This. I think it‚Äôs a reference to the gladiators in Roman Empire, who were sold to the nobles for sexual purposes if they became popular. In Hunger Games it‚Äôs especially dark, considering most of them would have been a minor at that time.
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: Annie.. they probably trafficked Annie. Who was mentally ill after her games! That is seriously f'ed up!
Sentiment: negative

Comment: The way the hunger games makes the people of each district view the people of other districts, and even people in their own district, as enemies. The best example of this is: Rue believed that the people of District 12 are allowed to have all the coal that they want, and Katniss believed the same about district 11 and their crops. It‚Äôs kind of subtle, but it makes them feel like they‚Äôre alone in their plight, and it‚Äôs very likely that this was deliberate, and very widespread among the districts.      Each district is kept isolated from each other without any news of what is going on, and in other parts of the country. The most they see of people from other districts is during the reaping, and the games. Even alliances between the competitors end up being broken because only one person can make it out alive. The games keep the districts divided, so they can never rebel against the capital.      (Edit: spelling and wanted to add some to my rant)
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: Sounds very familiar‚Ä¶
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: Not to mention they make people within their own district resent each other. The volunteer system (no one on the outer districts volunteers even when someone as vulnerable as a 12 year old like rue is reaped until katniss) and the tesserae system where children who are in more poverty have more chances of being reaped than children whose names are only in there in proportion to their age.
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: I think a lot of people gloss over just how many names were in the bowl with Prim‚Äôs. In the first book, Katniss says she entered her name 20 times and Gale‚Äôs name is entered 42 times because they took out tesserae. I wish this was included in the movies because now I keep seeing ridiculous ‚Äútheories‚Äù that all the names were Prim‚Äôs and Katniss was ‚Äúthe chosen one‚Äù. Which would like‚Ä¶ completely defeat the entire purpose of the books.
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: Yeah the lack of reading comprehension on tiktok is getting scary
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: It was deliberate. By keeping the districts* at each others throats so to speak, the capitol hoped it would keep the downtrodden from rising up in unity against the capitol.      *Even in the individual districts themselves, the tessarae system divided the workers from the merchants.
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: The pods in the Capitol- those were definitely there before a war started. People lived their lives walking by death traps that just weren‚Äôt ‚Äúturned on‚Äù. It‚Äôs an uncomfortable feeling. Everyone‚Äôs life in Panem was at Snows finger tips.
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: Yeah I hated in the last film they talked about as if Snow had recently had those pods installed. In the books, they had been there for years and it appears the Capitol citizens knew (as Cressida knew). They just apparently didn't think about it as they were left turned off. Snow could have just killed a bunch of people at anytime with one and blamed the rebels.
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: Werent at least some of them there since the dark days too?
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: Maybe some, but as of the second book, it's been 75 years since The Hunger Games were started. I want to think in the book the Dark Days took 3-5 years, so we're talking like 80 years if we go from the start. Snow's probably one of the few people who's been there since the Dark Days.
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: my jaw dropped when I opened the first page of BSBS and was like ‚Äúomg how old is Tigris‚Äù cause I recognized her from mockingjay
Sentiment: positive

Comment: The cost of the hunger games could feed all the 12 districts
Sentiment: negative

Comment: Parallel to the idea that irl the top 1% richest people could distribute the money they have and everybody would be living comfortably
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: That‚Äôs‚Ä¶that‚Äôs not how economics and the real world work
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: Yeah of course but it‚Äôs in theory. It can‚Äôt ACTUALLY happen but the math is there      This is not a debate on economics, it‚Äôs a comment on the distribution of resources and the ways in which even though there might be enough (food, money, etc) to go around for everyone, some people have excess and some people are deficient
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: You can‚Äôt just give every single human $10 million and expect for problems to disappear forever. That‚Äôs how you destabilize economies across the globe and end up helping no one. If everyone has $10 million in their pockets, what do you do when the price for a load of bread shoots $10 billion?
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: This brings me back to the party at the President's mansion during the Victory Tour. Katniss and Peeta discover people there literally drink something to make themselves sick so they can eat more. One person even mentions using it a couple times already that night. All this waste and abundance while folks are starving in the districts.
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: Things like this unfortunately happen way too often in real life. Like somebody would spend thousands of dollars for a dress a celebrity wore for one night instead of feeding starving children with that money.
Sentiment: negative

Comment: I would phrase what you said a bit different. "The resources poured into the games could make life better for everyone".
Sentiment: positive

Comment: The fact that multiple times (at least in the first book), tributes are either said to have been nude in the past or are presented very provocatively. It says that district 12 tributes have been naked and covered in coal dust in the past for the parade. It also says that the female district 1 tribute is in a see through dress for the interviews  They are literal children and not only are they slaughtering each other for entertainment, they are paraded in a sexual way to gain sponsorships which ultimately just gives the capitol more money.
Sentiment: negative

Comment: I think this one gets overlooked a lot because a lot of the teenagers reading the books when they first came out might not have been so immediately aware of truly how horrific the thought of sexualizing children like that is. Not to say that teenagers don't understand that things like that are wrong, but my perspective as a 16 year old was more like 'wow yeah that would really suck' and my perspective as a 26 year old is 'fucking MONSTERS' and a lot of rage.
Sentiment: positive

Comment: Dude yes! I read these as a literal preteen and was more into the whole romance part. Now as an adult I fully realize how fucked up the whole thing is. It‚Äôs even worse that it‚Äôs an actual allegory of the current, and possibly future, state of this country. Also Katniss being kissed on the lips by Chaff, a grown ass man??? Johanna stripping for no reason?? Finnick being seductive? She was 17 man..
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: Yes! Especially when after Katniss wins the 74th games, she comments on how she lost a lot of weight. While she is being dressed for a the victory tour (or interview? unsure, but it‚Äôs after the games), there‚Äôs a comment made about how they wanted to surgically enhance her breasts but ‚Äúcompromised‚Äù on adding padding to her dress to give her curves. Very gross considering she‚Äôs 16!
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: Reading them as a mother was a totally different experience.  Honestly the movies hit harder too. The actress who played Prim has the absolute most heartbreaking scream in the world.  That opening scene has me choked up and slightly nauseous before the story even begins.
Sentiment: positive

Comment: Wasn‚Äôt finnick forced into prostitution at 14 or 15? That‚Äôs some messed up shit
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: honestly just connecting those 2 pieces in my mind, that ‚Äúsexy‚Äù was a way these tributes could try and make themselves perceived for their interviews on stuff, and that some of these tributes are as young as 12, like rue
