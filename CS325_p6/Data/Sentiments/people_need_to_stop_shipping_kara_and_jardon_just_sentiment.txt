Comment: Yes, people should stop shipping them, but not for that reason, but rather to respect what they're saying and stop being annoying.      Whether they're strangers that just met or they've known each other for years, doesn't matter.      Also, logically speaking, being in a relationship with someone you've been friend for years is better and more meaningful than just dating someone you just known for a few months. And people feelings can change and develop. So that argument doesn't even make sense.

Comment: Platonic friendships between men and women are just as important as romantic ones. Kara and Jordan clearly love each other even if it is just as friends and that is okay. It's hard to find friendship like theirs. Whether they are or are not a couple really doesn't matter.   I have enjoyed both their content for almost five years now and I couldn't care less about what they do in their personal lives just as long as they are happy and are in a good place in their lives. :)

Comment: It's one thing to ship your favorite fictional characters it a whole nother thing to ship real people whom wish to not be shipped.
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: Yeah, I donâ€™t think anything good ever comes from shipping or theorizing about real peopleâ€™s relationships
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: Simple fact of the matter is that their personal lives, aside from what they themselves choose to share with their viewers, is no one's business but their own. Jordan has always kept information about his relationship status private, I'd imagine Kara is similar in that regard, and would certainly respect Jordan's wishes to keep such things private, so if they were together in that way, they'd never tell us, and they'd have no obligation to do so. Something some of both streamers' viewers need to just accept (I imagine the majority of viewers are respectful). Not to mention it's creepy and disrespectful to ship real life people just in general. Whatever they are, they should be left to it in peace, as we enjoy the content they provide us.

Comment: Last month (I think it was in a Tuesday Chilled lobby) she said explicitly she was single by choice.
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: If they actually care about Jardoon and Kara they wonâ€™t, as that would be annoying and or cause them stress. Unfortunately, self awareness isnâ€™t in unlimited supply.
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: They are what they say they are and what they have seems pretty great. Adults in healthy romantic relationships don't try to hide that fact. Why would they? That would be juvenile and silly. That being said, I don't think they'll ever stop the middle schoolers with their "Jordan and Kara, sitting in a tree..." chants. That's just how the internet works.

Comment: Couple months ago when he wanted to move

Comment: Captain sold his house for like 4 million, I don't think he needs to get a roommate to afford housing ðŸ’€ðŸ’€

Comment: This is very incorrect.
Sentiment: negative

Comment: Did he mention that he sold it for 15 million?
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: Not that I can recall.  The only thing I have seen is him saying that he lost money on it.  I imagine the sale information is available if you really wanted to search for it though.

Comment: He literally has over a million dollars and he probably made like 5 to 10 million on his old house and Iâ€™m pretty certain that he said that she wanted a roommate
Sentiment: positive

Comment: He has confirmed that he lost money on the house
Sentiment: Negative

Comment: I know people who do this so they can split rent and save money but still friends.
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: I love their friendship, its so wholesome and funny. Would love to have a friend like either of them. I wish people would stop shipping people as though they are fictional characters. Do people forget that they are real people? Its very odd thing to do
Sentiment: positive

Comment: I'll be completely honest, aside from having roommates in college/uni, and the rise (and was there a fall?) of content houses, I have never in my life heard of friends moving in together voluntarily, especially when money isn't a problem.      Learning about them moving in together recently was really surprising.      Then again, my almost decade of watching Jardon has instead given me the impression of him being the most ace person I will ever see. Though that's the impression, the real deal is a whole other matter.      And because of my impression as written in the previous paragraph, I have never really cared about knowing whether the captain is in a romantic/sexual relationship with anyone, honestly. Sure, in terms of not harrassing people over "ships", I apply that to practically every creator I watch, but this principle is exceptionally strong with Jardon.      Like, asking why they decided to move in together, that in itself is not bad, cause IMO that's still kinda mindblowing even for the best of friends to move in together. But of course the issue arises when the shipping of real people starts.
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: Donâ€™t forget these are two people who have been friends for like 5 years now and have always played games together and I think they both were looking to move it just so happens that he probably was looking and her chat or she found out herself and asked him if he wanted to move in with her
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: My thoughts are that it does not matter how many years friends have known each other, whether they're the same/opposite gender, whether their orientation does/doesn't match one another, it must be incredibly incredibly rare for even the bestest and longest of friends to move into the same house together. I am not claiming they're in a relationship or denying their friendship, I'm just stating how rare that is.      Also,      and I think they both were looking to move it just so happens that he probably was looking and her chat or she found out herself and asked him if he wanted to move in with her      Is this conjecture or actually confirmed?
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: I heard from someone who watches her streams and they said that she was looking for a roommate
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: What if we maybe kept things to ourselves instead of making it other people's problems when it comes to shipping maybe. What if people can choose to live together platonically or not and we don't have to pester them about it and can keep whatever conversations out of their way
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: Didnâ€™t they meet on the earth smp? That was one of the first captain sparklez videos I ever watched
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: The story goes:      They had the same managing company, and they were introduced because they got a lot of similar sponsorships and could play them together. She had no idea who he was. Their oldest known collab is an Apex stream from March 2019, 3 months before she joined SMPLive.
Sentiment: None

Comment: they met each other before that and the first game they streamed together was Apex Legends which you can find on his second channel
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: Iâ€™m pretty sure it was the smp live or the one you mentioned but they have known each other for a long while now
Sentiment: neutral

Comment: I thought they lived on neighbouring islands during the Deep End but every list I find of streamers who did that series didnâ€™t include Kara. SMP Live seems to have started before Earth so itâ€™s probably that, although Iâ€™m sure they interacted more on Earth.
