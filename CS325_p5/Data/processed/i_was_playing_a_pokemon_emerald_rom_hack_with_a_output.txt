So every Delphox always has all three of those and then on top of that, for abilities it has the choice of 1 of these 3:      Immolate - Normal type moves become fire type and have a 10% power boost      Neuroforce - Super effective moves are 25% stronger      Magic Guard - Regular magic guard      This Rom hack's philosophy definitely seems to be \"make everything OP, so that nothing is\".

Theta Emerald EX.  https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/zd2epw/what_are_the_best_pokemon_emerald_enhancement/    It's harder than base game by quite a lot but not nearly Kaizo levels. It has physical/special split too.      Another option is to play either Omega Ruby or Alpha Sapphire, I really enjoyed that, and I reckon it's pretty faithful to the originals (I played Ruby back in the day). Going for ORAS first could be better, get an experience that is closer to the original experience but with just small improvements and way better graphics. I would guess that ORAS are more similar to normal Emerald than Theta Emerald EX.",
