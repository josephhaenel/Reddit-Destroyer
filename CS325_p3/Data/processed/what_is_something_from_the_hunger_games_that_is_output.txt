I always thought it was kind of a plot hole that these events never got brought up again, because this seems to me like another valid as to why people would turn on the Capitol seeing as they let hundreds of their own citizens carelessly get caught in their death traps. Even though the casualties were Capitol people, they were still innocent lives that got taken in an unnecessarily violent manner and it never sat right with me.

People of all political ideologies (left, right, liberal, conservative, libertarian) watch the films and read the books, but one aspect that often gets ignored is the lack of weapons. This is why the districts are literally unable to rebel; the only reason why they were able to revolt during the First/Second Rebellions was because District 13 supplied them with weapons, mainly guns.      Even if the district citizens had just AR-15 rifles, they could have easily overthrown the Capitol in a day. The Peacekeepers would be vastly outnumbered and completely wiped out.      Another dark aspect that often gets ignored is mass surveillance. Why do citizens accept both mass surveillance and gun control in the name of safety?
